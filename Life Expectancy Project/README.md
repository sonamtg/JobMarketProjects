# Life Expectancy Calculation, Weighting, and Reweighting Analysis

## Required Files and 

Data
- microdata.csv - This is an individual-level dataset, with two variables for each individual: birth year and death year. When an individual is still alive as of the present, death year = NA. This dataset is used for the analysis in the Life Expectancy.Rmd file.
- data-task-year-race-education-collapse.csv. - This contains aggregated data on mortality rates and population counts by year, race, education, and age. This is used for the Life Expectancy for the Race and Edu.Rmd

- Code
- Life Expectancy.Rmd
- Life Expectancy by Race and Edu.Rmd

## Sequence of running code files

- Run LifeExpectancy.Rmd 
- Run Life Expectancy by Race and Edu.Rmd
- Note: Make sure all packages are installed first and to set your working directory with both the datasets

## Output Produced
Two individual pdf files
Life-Expectancy.pdf - Regression and Life Expectancy
Life-Expectancy-by-Race-and-Edu.pdf - Weighting and Reweighting method to find Life Exppectancy by Race and Education
