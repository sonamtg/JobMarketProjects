S1e1,PETER:,"No, thanks. See, that's the worst we got is Jemima's Witnesses."
S1e1,LOIS:,"[Singing.] ""It seems today that all you see ""is violence in movies and sex on TV ""But where are those good, old-fashioned values ""on which we used to rely? ""Lucky there's a family guy ""Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you ""all the things that make us ""laugh 'n' cry ""He's a family guy"" [Cheery instrumental music.]"
S1e1,MEG:,"Mom, my lips are too thin. Can I please get collagen injections? Meg, you don't need to change the way you look. You know, most of the world's problems stem from poor self-image. [Polka music playing in gym.] [Man and women laughing.] [Growling.] Excellent! The mind-control device is nearing completion!"
S1e1,LOIS:,"Stewie, I said no toys at the table. Damn you, vile woman! You've impeded my work since the day I escaped from your wretched womb. Don't pout, honey. When you were born the doctor said you were the happiest looking baby he'd ever seen. But, of course. That was my victory day. The fruition of my deeply-laid plans to escape from that cursed ovarian bastille! Return the device, woman! No toys, Stewie. Very well, then. Mark my words, when you least expect it, your uppance will come! [Suspenseful instrumental music.] Mom, can I turn the heat up? Don't touch the thermostat, Meg. Your father gets upset. Come on. This thing goes up to 90. Who touched the thermostat? God, how does he always know? Brain implant, Meg. Every father's got one. Tells you when the kids mess with the dial."
S1e1,GUY:,"My thing went off! Your thermostat okay? - Yeah, it's all right. - Is my kid over here? Forget it! False alarm!"
S1e1,BRIAN:,"Ass ahoy. Peter, it's 7:00 and you've still got your pants on. What's the occasion? He's going to a stag party. Lois, I work hard all week to provide for this family. I am the man of the house. As the man, I order you to give me permission to go to this party. Look, at least promise me you won't drink. Alcohol always leads to trouble. Come on. You're worrying about nothing. Remember when you got drunk off the Communion wine at church? And so the Lord God smote poor Job with festering boils all over his body. Man, I hate it when he tells this story."
S1e1,PRIEST:,"Yet, miraculously, Job was still able to retain his dignity. - Is that really the blood of Christ? - Yes. Man, that guy must've been wasted And then there was that time at the ice cream store. Butter Rum's my favorite. Remember you had an Irish coffee the day we went to see Philadelphia? [Audience crying.] I got it. That's the guy from Big. Tom Hanks, that's it. Funny guy, Tom Hanks. Everything he says is a stitch. I have AIDS. - Promise me, Peter. - Lois, honey, I promise. Not a drop of alcohol is gonna touch these lips tonight. Who wants to play Drink The Beer? Right here. - You win. - All right. What do I win? Another beer! I'm going for the high score! Actually, Charlie's got the high score. Man. Your clock won't flush. I feel kind of bad, guys. I promised my wife I wouldn't drink. - Don't feel bad, Peter. - Gee. I never thought of it like that. Did you bring the porno? Did I bring the porno? You're gonna love it. It's a classic. Listen, Ilsa. If I take this thing out and you're not on it, you'll regret it. Not today or tomorrow."
S1e1,RICK:,"But soon, and for the rest of your life. Come on, llsa! Get on it! [Funky music on TV.]"
S1e1,"NARRATOR:","The statue was a gift from France. What is this? Man. My kid must've taped over this for history class. [Groans.] The Statue of Liberty? What are we gonna do? - Boys, we're gonna drink till she's hot. - That's just crazy enough to work. Meg, finish your pancakes. - Chris, elbows off your father. - Thanks, son. a great example for the kids, Peter. Yeah. A new family record. Way to raise the bar, Dad. Chris, you're 13. Don't talk like that. Kids, Daddy only drank so the Statue of Liberty would take her clothes off. - What did you promise me last night? - I wouldn't drink at the stag party. - And what did you do? - Drank at the stag I almost walked right into that one. God! Feels like accountants are cranking adding machines in my head. [Machines whirring.] Dick, you ever wonder what's outside those walls? That's dangerous thinking, Paul. You best stick to your work. Okay. You see? A hangover is nature's way of telling you I was right. I mean"
S1e1,MEG:,"Mom, are you all right?"
S1e1,LOIS:,"My goodness. This chair leg was loose. Isn't that silly? I could've broken my neck. Damn! [Suspenseful instrumental music.] Honey. I took a cab home, I slept on the table so I wouldn't wake you up. Nothing bad happened. I guess you're right. Apology accepted. All right, I'm going to work. Somebody's gotta put food on this table. How are you coming, Johnson? Mr. Weed, I've been working on the new G.I. Jew line. And as you can see, they look great. You call these bagels? I'm glad he's on our side! [Snoring.] MR."
S1e1,WEED:,Peter!
S1e1,PETER:,"What? Are you sleeping on the job? No. There's a bug in my eye and I'm trying to suffocate him. Peter, I like you. But I need you to be more than just eye candy around here. It's your job to watch for toys that could be hazardous to kids. - Now, look sharp! - Yes, sir! [Snoring.] [Foreboding instrumental music.] And now back to Action News 5. Our top story tonight, ""When Toys Attack."" Quite a situation we've got here, Tom. Quite a situation we've got here, Tom, indeed, Diane. The Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Company of Quahog, Rhode Island has released highly unsafe products into the retail market. Come on, Timmy! Throw the Silly Ball! Boy! A Pound Poochie! Come on, Baby Heimlich, spit it out. Peter, I'm appalled. Your negligence has damaged this company's reputation. You're fired! Jeez. For how long? [Sad instrumental music.] My God! You got fired? - Way to go, Dad! Fight the machine! - How do you know about the machine?"
S1e1,PETER:,Don't worry. I'll still put food on this table. Just not as much. So it might get a little competitive. Who cares about food? Now we'll never be able to afford my lip injections!
S1e1,BRIAN:,Can we put her out in the yard for a while?
S1e1,LOIS:,"Okay, who's hungry? Jeez. How the hell am I gonna break this to Lois? If she finds out I got fired for drinking, she's gonna blame me!"
S1e1,DEVIL:,"Lie to her. It's okay to lie to women. They're not people like us. I don't know. Hey, where's the other guy? [Cars honking.] Come on, you bastard! I'm late for work. This is perfect! Look, I don't want your mom to worry, all right? When she worries, she says, ""I told you so"" and: ""Stop doing that. I'm asleep."" So I'm just gonna tell a little lie, okay? Not a word to your mom about me getting canned."
S1e1,LOIS:,"What's that, Peter? - Nothing. The lost-my-job smells great. - What? Meg, honey, can you pass the fired-my-ass-for-negligence?"
S1e1,LOIS:,"Peter, are you feeling okay? I feel great! I haven't got a job in the world. All right, then let's eat. I know you all hate eggplant, but What on earth was that? What the deuce are you staring at? It's tuna fish and nothing else. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] How's your job search going? It sucks, Brian. I've already been through two jobs this week. I got fired off of that commercial."
S1e1,DIRECTOR:,Try it again.
S1e1,PETER:,"""I'm caca for Cocoa Puffs."""
S1e1,DIRECTOR:,"No, damn it! Take 26! Then I had that job as the sneeze guard for that restaurant's salad bar. Take it outside, lady. I thought I could win money in that talent show."
S1e1,EMCEE:,"And the prize goes to The von Trapp Family Singers! That is bull [Loud applause.] Peter, I know it's a dangerous precedent but you might want to tell Lois the truth. What? That I can't provide for my family? That she's always right? That I didn't stand up to a tank in Tiananmen Square? Screw this! I just came over to buy some fireworks! You can't keep lying to her about losing your job. Eventually, she'll find out where you're going every day. Yeah. [Bells and music on TV.] Yeah, you're right. Okay, I'll tell her tonight. [Crickets chirping.] [Suspenseful instrumental music.] [Mellow instrumental music.] Victory is mine!"
S1e1,LOIS:,"I'll need the checkbook in the morning. I'm going to Stop 'N Shop for some sweet corn. You're spending money on food again? Lois, we just had dinner. I enjoyed it so much, I thought we'd eat again tomorrow. Since when are you so concerned about our food budget? I just Lois, this is really hard for me to say, but What is it, Peter? - You're getting kind of fat. - What? It's just It's not healthy. Peter, I do my Jane Fonda workout tape three times a week. When was the last time you saw your toes? I thought you people were supposed to be jolly. Peter, what the hell is the matter with you? Honey, if there's something wrong, you can tell me. - Sorry, man. Am I late? What did I miss? - Thank God you're here. What do I do? Tell him to keep quiet. He's in too deep. I don't know. Where's the other guy? [Cars honking.] This is unbelievable! I promise you, everything's fine. You got nothing to worry about."
S1e1,STEWIE:,"Well, well, Mother! We meet again! Stewie, I thought I tucked you in an hour ago. Not tightly enough it would seem. And now you contemptible harpy I shall end your reign of matriarchal tyranny."
S1e1,LOIS:,"You can play tomorrow, honey. Right now it's bedtime. Blast you and your estrogenical treachery!"
S1e1,PETER:,"Sweet dreams, kiddo. You have the power to end this! How'd she take it? I told her she was fat. No. I hate lying to Lois. It's just It's the best way to keep her from the truth. You have no choice. Your unemployment will dry up soon. She'll probably sense something's amiss when they repossess your house. You really oughta think of your family's welfare. Jeez, Brian! That's a great idea! Okay, do you have any disabilities, past injuries, physical anomalies? I didn't have gas for the first time until I was 30. [Breaks wind.] What the hell was that?"
S1e1,PETER:,"Guys, our money problems are over! We're officially on welfare. Come on, help me scatter car parts on the front lawn. How much are we getting? Let's see. $150 a week. Wait. That's a comma, not a decimal. [Uplifting instrumental music.] Whoops. No, I haven't seen Peter all afternoon. I was giving a piano lesson. Stewie, why don't you play in the other room? Why don't you burn in hell? No dessert for you, young man. Who would've thought getting drunk would get me $150,000 a week from the government? This is why I don't vote. Maybe somebody down there was drinking, too. Mr. President, why do you think the public supports you during these impeachment proceedings? Probably because you're so fat. Peter, you might want to call the Welfare Commission. That check is obviously an oversight. Not necessarily. Maybe I'm like their one millionth customer."
S1e1,BRIAN:,"What? You're gonna spend $150,000 a week? - Yeah. - On what?"
S1e1,LOIS:,"Oh, my God! Peter, you bought the statue of David? No. I just rented it. But they're gonna be ticked. The penis broke off while I was loading it into the car. I shall call you ""Eduardo."" Peter, how can we afford this? You won't believe it, Mom! Dad's getting A big raise! Peter, that's wonderful! But, Dad, I thought The kind of raise that'll allow me to give my kids a big allowance just for keeping their big mouths shut. Come on, guys. I'll buy us the most expensive meal we've ever had. Yeah. I'd like 6,000 chicken fa-ji-tas, please."
S1e1,CLERK:,"I beg your pardon? And a ""So-sage"" McBiscuit, please. Peter, what's the big surprise? You know how I always said you should be treated like a queen? I got you your own jester."
S1e1,JESTER:,"Good to be here in New England. And what's the deal with ""New"" England anyway? It's over 200 years old! Last time I checked, that's not that new. This is great. I can finally afford to give my little girl the lips she's always dreamed of."
S1e1,MEG:,"Thank you, Daddy! [Kisses Peter.] I don't know, Peter. Lips are one thing. But did you have to buy breast implants for Chris? It makes him happy. These are cool."
S1e1,MAILWOMAN:,"When did you get a pool? It's a moat. I know it's silly but my husband thinks our family needs extra protection now that we're rich. Does it work? It does keep the Black Knight at bay. [Horse sputtering.] Congratulations in all your success. Here's your welfare check. What the [Foghorn blowing.] Hi, honey. What?"
S1e1,PETER:,"I know what I did was wrong. But I only did it for you and the kids. Except for the jukebox in the bathroom. That was for Peter. Yeah, from the American taxpayers. I am so mad I can't see straight. No problem. We got money to get that fixed with enough left for us to buy our way out of any trouble our kids might get into. Just like the Kennedys."
S1e1,LOIS:,"I feel like I don't even know you anymore, Peter. The man I married would never think he could fix a problem just by spending money! Boy, she's pretty pissed. Who thought fraud would be one of her buttons? Why have a jukebox in the john if your wife's mad at you? Peter, you may have to return that money to the taxpayers. But I gotta make sure Lois knows I'm doing it. I need an event with thousands of people. Something that everybody cares about. We might have to leave Rhode Island for this."
S1e1,ANNOUNCER:,"The air is electric here at Super Bowl XXXIII tonight! Pat, it's safe to say that all these fans came out here to watch a game of football! John, we're in commercial. Yeah, I know. I'm just making conversation. Come on. Football! Amazing. You can barely drive a car. Yet you were allowed to fly a blimp? Yeah, America's great, isn't it? Except for the South. Boy, I hope Lois is watching. Okay, taxpayers, here you go!"
S1e1,PAT:,"Looks like we're getting some rain here tonight, John. Yeah. Hey, wait a second! This is no ordinary rain! It's some kind of crazy money rain! I'm being told it's a man and his dog throwing cash out of a blimp. Man. I hope this works. Otherwise, I'm gonna have to start dropping these. [People cheering.]"
S1e1,JOHN:,"The crowd is storming the field! This is pandemonium! Have you ever seen anything like this, Pat? Just once. The 1975 Cotton Bowl. This is the old ""trying to make amends ""for spending $150,000 a week in misappropriated welfare funds"" play. I don't care what it is! That guy's ruining a perfectly good game of football! - Madden to Fox Security. - Go ahead."
S1e1,JOHN:,Take them down!
S1e1,GUARD:,"Yes, sir. How was your shower? I tell you, all of the rumors about dropping the soap are true. Really? You can't hold onto that thing to save your life. It was slipping everywhere. Guys were laughing."
S1e1,GUY:,"There's the guy that couldn't hold the soap. That was classic. Boy. I really let Lois down this time. Do you think she'll wait for me? If every woman dumped her husband for crashing a blimp, no one would be married. Yeah, you're right. Okay, I got the top bunk. My collagen is wearing off. Honey, sagging lips are just nature's way of telling you you shouldn't cover for your father's lie. What does it mean when your armpits cry stinky tears? It means you're becoming a man. But hopefully not the kind who stays out all day and doesn't call like your father who shall remain nameless."
S1e1,STEWIE:,"Hello, Mother."
S1e1,LOIS:,"Hi there, sweetie. You know, Mother, life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get. Your life, however, is more like a box of active grenades! [Dramatic instrumental music.]"
S1e1,STEWIE:,"Now, I offer one last chance for deliverance. Return my mind-control device or be destroyed. You just want your toy back. Okay, here you go, honey. Yes Well, victory is mine! [Explosion.]"
S1e1,STEWIE:,"Damn you all! [Phone ringing.] [Phone ringing.] Hello? Oh, my God! Lois, am I glad to see you. I have nothing to say to you, Peter. I gave the money back. Why are you still steamed? Peter, you lied to me, you betrayed my trust. Compared to that, welfare fraud doesn't even matter. Really? Let's hope the judge feels that way. This court will come to order. I figured the sooner I cashed the check the sooner they'd catch their mistake. Why are we making a federal case out of this? Don't you think you should have alerted the government of such a gross overpayment? I was gonna call them. But my favorite episode of Different Strokes was on. The one where Arnold and Dudley get sexually molested by the bike shop owner? All right. Now I want you boys to scream real loud at my ass. And everybody learns a valuable lesson. Mr. Griffin, have you learned a lesson? Yes. Stay the hell away from that bike shop. [People murmuring.] Okay, everybody, I feel really bad about what I did. I just I don't know. I saw the one chance l'd ever have to give my family the things they deserve. I guess I screwed it up. I cheated the government. And worst of all, I lied to my wife. And she deserves better. I'm sorry, honey. Mr. Griffin, I think your words have touched us all. I'm sentencing you to 24 months in prison. No! - No! - No! No! Yeah! [Rock music.] [Rock music stops abruptly.]"
S1e1,LOIS:,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
S1e1,JUDGE:,"Yes? Look, my husband may be a bit thoughtless at times. He may even be downright stupid. But I know he only accepted that money because he wanted to be a good husband and father. But what he needs to remember is that we love him. And no matter what, I'll always stand by him. I love you too, honey. That was very moving, Mrs. Griffin. Okay, you can go to jail with him! What? Intolerable as it may be l'm completely dependent upon those wretched drones for sustenance. Let us see how the constitution of American justice fares against the device! [Device pulsates.] Is that your boy? What? Yeah. That's Stewie. Gosh. I can't separate a kid that young from his father. It's unjudgmenly. - Hell, you've learned your lesson, right? - Yeah. - All right. You're free. - Wow! Can you give me my job back? No. - Yes. - All right! [Cheery instrumental music.] [Man laughing on TV.]"
S1e1,ED:,"That was a crazy one, Dick."
S1e1,DICK:,"It sure was. In this next blooper from Joanie Loves Chachi watch what happens when Scott Baio tries to say: ""She sells seashells down by the seashore."" What does your mom do? She sells seashells down by the That is kind of a tongue twister. It's good to have you home, Peter. Honey, I knew everything would turn out okay. I sure am gonna miss being rich."
S1e1,PETER:,Don't worry. I got a way to get money. Not another welfare scam? No. Minority scholarship. [Giggles.] [Jazzy instrumental music.] LOIS AND
S1e1,BRIAN:,No.
S1e1,STEWIE:,"Are you insane? Okay, I mean sexual harassment suit. [Giggles.]"
S1e1,BRIAN:,No.
S1e1,LOIS:,Don't think so.
S1e1,STEWIE:,"Absolutely outrageous. Okay, disability claim. [Theme music.]"
S1e2,LOIS:,Look at Stewie. Isn't he adorable playing with his Sesame Street phone? Put me through to the Pentagon.
S1e2,ERNIE:,What sound does a cow make?
S1e2,STEWIE:,"Don't toy with me! I've already dispatched with Mr. Hooper. I've six armed men outside Big Bird's nest. And as for Linda? It's difficult for a deaf woman to hear an assassin approach, isn't it?"
S1e2,ERNIE:,Can you count to three?
S1e2,STEWIE:,"Indeed I can. One! Two! Three! Can I count to three? For God's sake, I'm already shooting at a fifth-grade level."
S1e2,LOIS:,"[Singing.] ""It seems today that all you see ""is violence in movies and sex on TV ""But where are those good, old-fashioned values ""on which we used to rely? ""Lucky there's a family guy ""Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you ""all the things that make us ""laugh 'n' cry ""He's a family guy"" Come on, Stewie. You can't leave the table until you finish your vegetables. Then I shall sit here until one of us expires. You've got a good 40 years on me, woman! Sweetie, it's broccoli. It's good for you. Now open up for the airplane. [Makes airplane noise.] Never! Damn the broccoli! Damn you! And damn the Wright Brothers! My, aren't we fussy tonight. Okay. No broccoli. Very well then. L Who the hell do you think you are? Honey, it's not gonna go away just because you don't like it. Well, then. My goal becomes clear. The broccoli must die. [Sinister instrumental music.] Mom, will you take me out to practice driving? I'm teaching a piano lesson in half an hour. Maybe your father can take you. Sorry, Meg. Daddy loves you. But Daddy also loves Star Trek. And, in all fairness, Star Trek was here first."
S1e2,KIRK:,"Captain's log, Stardate 8169.7. The Enterprise has just discovered a strange new planet in the Gamma Faloppia star system. Mr. Sulu, ahead Warp 9."
S1e2,LOIS:,"For God's sake, Peter. You've been in front of the TV since you got home from work. Why don't you spend some time with your family? I will, during the commercials. And if that's wrong, maybe I'm missing the point of having commercials. [Sighs.] Please. My road test is tomorrow and you haven't taught me anything. You may want to find a better teacher than Peter. What are you talking about? I'm a great driver. Remember your trip to the Southwest? [Road Runner meep-meeping.] - Jeez. Did I just hit that ostrich? - No. - Are you sure? - He's fine. Keep going. Don't believe that. I always keep my eyes on the road."
S1e2,PETER:,I don't miss a thing.
S1e2,TV:,"We now return to Star Trek. Holy crap. Uhura's black? All right, Meg. Now here's your first lesson. You always want to be aware of other cars on the road. If you catch eyes with the guy next to you at a red light, you gotta race him. - This guy's asking for it. - But Dad I don't make the rules, honey. Now rev your engine twice. Okay. [Engine revving twice.] [Horse sputtering twice.] Go! [Fast-paced instrumental music.] [Screaming.] [Dramatic instrumental music.]"
S1e2,PETER:,"You forgot to flip him off. But other than that, nice job. You're back already? That wasn't much of a lesson. I didn't want to overload her on her first time out. Besides CHiPs is about to start. So let's sit back and get lost in a world of California Highway Patrol fantasy! [Police siren.] [Funky instrumental music.] - What's the charge, Officer? - Driving without my phone number. [Gunshots firing.] Or maybe I should arrest you for being too beautiful. [Teeth sparkling.] So, broccoli, Mother says you're very good for me. I'm afraid I'm no good for you! The first rule of war is know thine enemy. And I know this! Cold kills broccoli! It's so simple. All I need to do is build a machine to control the global environment. Forecast for tomorrow, a few sprinkles of genius with a chance of doom! [Sinister instrumental music.]"
S1e2,PETER:,"This is taking forever! Come on. Let's go. Fox is running one of those new reality shows at 8:00. Fast Animals, Slow Children. [African instrumental music.] Come on, guys. Wait up. [African music continues.] Dang. I got honey all over my legs. Dad, we can't leave now. My entire life depends on getting my license. If I can't drive, I'll never have a boyfriend, never get married and then I'll have to adopt a kid like Rosie O'Donnell. Are you implying that Rosie O'Donnell can't drive? I'm so nervous. You're gonna do great. Remember everything I taught you. - Let's start by going down Main Street. - Okay. [Engine revving twice.] [Police siren.] - What are you doing? - I'm driving. [Screaming.] Are you gonna mark me down for not flipping him off? God, my life is over. I am the biggest loser I know! I know how you feel, pumpkin. I've had my share of disappointments, too."
S1e2,DOCTOR:,It's a girl! Can you check again? You just have to remember that life has its little ups and Jeez! We're gonna miss the beginning of my show. There it is.
S1e2,MEG:,"Dad, watch out! [Horn blaring.]"
S1e2,PETER:,"Meg, honey, are you okay?"
S1e2,MEG:,"Yeah, I think so."
S1e2,PETER:,"The Quahog Cable Television Transmitter. [Citizens grumbling.] You just knocked out cable TV for the whole town! Boy! Look. There's Bigfoot! Whoa. This isn't about me. This is about you. At least I bought us some time. - She did it. - What? Dad, you were the one driving! I was teaching her to drive and she lost control of the car. Come on, we all did stupid stuff when we were kids, right? I remember when I tried to sneak into an R-rated movie. - Come on. Give the kid a break, huh? - Why should we? She got her arm shot off in Vietnam. [Murmuring.]"
S1e2,GUY:,Poor kid.
S1e2,MAN:,"What a senseless war. I can't believe you just sold out your own daughter. I know what I did was wrong. And I know it's not the first time I've embarrassed you. And if you add the measure of the angles of a right triangle, the sum Meg, clean out the shower the next time you shave your legs. It's like a carpet in there. I hate to see you so upset. I know. Let's play a little game called Taking the Fall for Daddy. If you win, I'll buy you a convertible when you get your license. Really? Daddy! Now I love you again! You're gonna make some Jewish guy a great wife. [Metallic clanking.] Because of an accident at the Quahog Cable Company television transmission will be out for an undetermined amount of time. Of course, no one can see this news program so it doesn't really matter what we say. I'm the Lord Jesus Christ. Think I'll go get drunk and beat up midgets. How about you? Tom, I just plain don't like black people. You guys, we're still on in Boston. Excellent. The weather machine is nearly completed. What do you say to that, broccoli? Stop mocking me! What's this? It appears the witless provider has finally brought me something of value. I can use that crude device to amplify my deadly signal. Victory shall yet be mine. Guess what, Mom? Dad crashed the car into the city cable transmitter. - What? - It's okay. If I take the blame, he'll buy me a convertible when I get my license. Meg, it's not exactly taking the blame if you go around telling everyone. Peter, you're bribing your daughter with a car? Come on, Lois. Isn't ""bribe"" just another word for ""love""? You wanted me and Meg to bond. That's what we're doing."
S1e2,CHRIS:,"Dad, I was in a chat room on America Online and Doomie 22 told me some idiot knocked out the cable. We could be without TV for weeks! Now, Chris, now let's not panic. We can manage just fine without TV. [Brian scoffs.] - What's that supposed to mean? - Face it, you're addicted to television. You're not exactly Mr. Cold Turkey. Remember when you gave up candy? I'll ask you one more time. You didn't eat anything in my factory? No. - I'm just asking - Are you calling me a liar? - I'm just saying - Shut up, Wonka. Yeah. That was different. I'll be fine. - Are you sure, honey? - For God's sake, you guys. You think I'm some simp who can't live without TV? Give me a break. - What's happening now? - Sipowicz is finding who stabbed the super. Are you gonna tell me, or am I gonna have to show you my ass? I ain't saying nothing! All right, it was Jimmy the Hat! Forget it, Mike. Without actually seeing his ass, this is just radio. Class, we were scheduled to watch a PBS program on the mating rituals of the nude large-breasted Weewok tribe of New Guinea. Unfortunately, Megan Griffin ruined TV. So instead, we're having a surprise test. WONDER YEARS"
S1e2,VOICE:,Suddenly I was public enemy number one. It was time to tell the truth. Wait! I didn't drive into the satellite dish! And who did? WONDER YEARS
S1e2,VOICE:,"I was just a 15-year-old girl. But at that moment, I realized I had a whole lifetime to make new friends. But only one chance to get a new car. And I had to take it. Okay, I did it."
S1e2,PETER:,I don't know how much longer I can last. It's been a whole week since I seen a TV show. I wonder what Scooby and the gang are up to now.
S1e2,"NARRATOR:","We now return to The Scooby Doo Murder Files. Gee whiz, gang. The killer gutted the victim, strangled him with his own intestines and then dumped the body in the river! - Jinkies! What a mystery! [Moaning.] You're right, Scoob. We're dealing with one sick son of a bitch. You just need to find something to fill the void that's left in your life. Lois has knitting, Chris has video games, Meg's learning how to drive. And me, I like the sauce. Whose leg do you have to hump to get a dry martini around here? [Moaning.] Can't live without TV. Must see TV. [Frightful instrumental music.] [Whimsical instrumental music.] [Sinister instrumental music.] [Dramatic instrumental music.] [Sighs.] Stewie, I expect you to finish off your vegetables. Rest assured, you relentless harridan, I expect I shall finish them all off! And you as well! Brian, I'm a little worried about Peter. Last night I woke up and he was channel surfing through static. I'm sure he'll find a way to cope. - Morning, Lois. - And you were worried. - Peter, what the hell is that? - It's my favorite TV family, the Griffins. Peter, you're scaring me. I'm beginning to think you're losing your grip on reality."
S1e2,PETER:,Boring. I'll go see what else is on.
S1e2,LOIS:,Peter! Keep an eye on Stewie. Don't move! [Making ridiculous noises.] [Screams.]
S1e2,STEWIE:,A little help?
S1e2,PETER:,"It's Glen Quagmire, the wacky next-door neighbor."
S1e2,PETER:,What's he up to this time?
S1e2,QUAGMIRE:,"I'm going to work! Him and his crazy get-rich-quick schemes. We have to find your father, Chris. He's not well. I never knew anyone who went crazy before except my invisible friend Col. Schwartz! I get all the channels on this thing. Lifetime. CBS. Hey, UPN. All right. 90210. - Dad? - Meg, what are you doing at West Beverly? They're really reaching for guest stars in the 10th season. Dad, what are you doing? Get out of here! I'm already a total outcast because of you! You're just upset because you wrecked the cable transmitter. I did not! Forget it. What good is a car if I have no friends? I didn't wreck TV! My dad did! - What? - What'd she say? - Peter Griffin ruined TV? - And blamed his daughter? That's the lowest thing I've ever heard. Peter, take that thing off and come home. Hey, Lois. You're just in time for the exciting conclusion. Looks like some boob's about to get lynched. Let's watch. There they are. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] That's the guy who ruined our cable. Let's get him! Stop! What is wrong with you people? Okay, yes. My husband is responsible for knocking out TV. But we should be thanking him. He's broken television's hypnotic spell over us. Now we can see the world for what it is a beautiful place full of wonderful things just waiting to be experienced. Another chick flick. She's right. All the hours we've wasted on that damn idiot box. - I'm gonna paint my house! - I'll build a ship in a bottle. I'm gonna push a hoop with a stick down a dirt road."
S1e2,LOIS:,"I'll take you home, honey. I can't believe I let Meg take the blame. You were right, Lois. TV is evil. I hear that Manson guy watches it in jail all day long. If I haven't seen it, it's new to me. You just went a little overboard. You need a little balance in your life. There are other things to appreciate besides television. - You mean like this lamp? - Yeah. Okay. - The lamp gives us light. - I get it. And your family gives you love. You should spend some time with our kids, Peter. And with me. What could me and you do together? [Naughty laugh.] Lois! You've got a sick mind! Peter, I'm talking about making love. I thought you wanted us to murder the children and harvest their organs for beer money. [Amorous giggling.] What a gorgeous day. Isn't it a gorgeous day, Mr. Sun? It's always a nice day with two scoops of raisins, Peter. [Car alarm blaring.] - Top of the morning, everybody. - Excellent! Thus completes the penultimate adjustment to my weather control device! Victory is Release me at once! Your mother was right. It'd be a crime to sit around and wait for the TV. - Great. You can teach me how to drive. - There'll be time to drive when you're dead. There's a world out there waiting for us to grab it by the short hairs! - Damn! - Let's go. [Cheery instrumental music.] I'm so tired. This morning's fly-fishing really wore me out. Wake up! You promised you'd get this hook out of my mouth. [Screams.] Thank you. Now, kids, your father's just trying to spend time with his family. Or kill us. I'm not sure which."
S1e2,TOM:,"The Chinese sure like to spit, don't they? Diane, that last report was so good, I think you deserve a spanking. I don't think your wife would appreciate that. That frigid old cow lives in Quahog. She can't hear a word I'm saying. Actually, we're back on the air in Quahog."
S1e2,STEWIE:,Thank God! Their puerile minds are once again distracted by that flickering box. Time to be bad!
S1e2,PETER:,"Come on, everyone. We're late for the Bavarian Folk Festival. You know those Germans. You don't join their party, they come get you. But Dad, the TV's back on. What do you know? Okay, let's go. Peter, I'm thrilled that you want to spend so much time with the family. But we're exhausted. Maybe we could just sit and watch some TV together? We're too busy living life to the fullest. Come on, let's go. - I'm sick of life. - Yeah. My dogs are barking. - But I thought we were having fun. - We were. But now it might be nice to watch other people have fun or get killed. - You know, whatever's on. - Look, Peter. It's your favorite show. This is a dangerous mission. And it's likely one of us will be killed. The landing party will consist of myself, Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Ensign Rickey. Crap. Sorry, Lois. There's only one show I want to see. It's called Make Every Day Count, starring Peter Griffin as himself."
S1e2,LOIS:,"Come on, Peter. Don't you miss TV just a little? The familiar stories, the broadly drawn characters, the convenient plot turns that bring a character around at exactly the right moment? Hi. I'm William Shatner. My car broke down on my way to give a speech on how TV keeps families together. Would you like to hear it? No, I don't want to miss the all-you-can-eat schnitzel bar. Wait a minute! I love schnitzel! Come along. I bet you could squeeze into Lois' lederhosen. I'll change in the car. If I had a nickel for every time one of my parents walked out instead of teaching me how to drive, I'd be one rich little Let's go, Meg. [Sinister instrumental music.] Fare thee well, broccoli! [Band playing German folk music.] I don't know. I can't imagine choosing life over television. I'm telling you, it's great, Bill. The only thing that would make this perfect day better is if my family was here. My God! It was sunny a moment ago, but now it's pouring! Let's take off our shoes and run home barefoot! Griffin, you're a madman! Barefoot, you say?"
S1e2,LOIS:,"This is not safe. I'll teach you how to drive some other time. Pull over. Mom, I can't even tell where ""over"" is. [Giddy laughter.] You were right, Peter. I've never felt so alive. Victory is mine! [Screams.]"
S1e2,STEWIE:,"God damn it. [Giddy laughter.] My God. [Car colliding.] My God. I hit William Shatner. Light growing dimmer. Can't breathe. Beam me up, God. I did not see that coming. Daddy, I'm sorry I ran you over and killed Mr. Shatner. Don't worry. Once I'm of this body cast, I'll do enough living for me and Bill. Honey, can't we go back to the way things used to be? There's a big dent in that couch that nobody else can fill. Haven't you guys learned anything? TV took over my life once. I'm never gonna let that happen again. My God. We've lost him. If you help me out of here, I know a meadow where the blueberries are begging to be picked. Look, buddy. Just go in the pan. And don't call me unless you're flatlining."
S1e2,PETER:,Turn that TV off. Nurse?
S1e2,ANNOUNCER:,What would you do for a Klondike Bar?
S1e2,ANNOUNCER:,Would you stand on one leg?
S1e2,MAN:,Sure.
S1e2,ANNOUNCER:,Would you act like a monkey?
S1e2,ANNOUNCER:,"Would you kill a man? [Gunshot.] Daddy, now that I've finally passed my driver's test can I still get a convertible? No. But I'm proud of you for getting your license, sweetheart. And I'm proud of you, Peter. You taught us all a valuable lesson. It's not what you do that defines the quality of your life it's who you do it with, and your family It's on. I know you don't like broccoli, Stewie, but you'll thank me when you grow up big and strong like your father. A compelling argument. You've swayed me, woman. That is good. I feel stronger already. It's good tasting and good for you. Nice try. - Quadruped. - Mutant. [Theme music.]"
S1e3,LOIS:,"[Singing.] ""It seems today that all you see ""is violence in movies and sex on TV ""But where are those good, old-fashioned values ""on which we used to rely? ""Lucky there's a family guy ""Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you ""all the things that make us ""laugh 'n' cry ""He's a family guy"" [Cheery instrumental music.]"
S1e3,LOIS:,Everything's all set for Stewie's birthday party. I can't believe he's almost a year old. Yeah. I'll never forget the day he was born.
S1e3,DOCTOR:,"One more push, Lois."
S1e3,DOCTOR:,"This is a miracle, Mr. Griffin. Would you like to see?"
S1e3,PETER:,"Yeah, I've never actually seen a baby being Oh, God!"
S1e3,DOCTOR:,Congratulations. It's a boy.
S1e3,DOCTOR:,"Wait a minute. I don't think we're through. Oh, my God! Is it twins?"
S1e3,DOCTOR:,"No. It's a map of Europe. [Sinister instrumental music.] I confirmed everything with the birthday party planner at Cheesie Charlie's. - Why Cheesie Charlie's? - It's cool, Dad. They have this game where you put in a dollar and you win four quarters! I win every time! I get to go, right? Why can't we have the same kind of party we always do? Peter, this could be our last first birthday ever. When Meg and Chris turned one, I had so much to do, I missed everything. [Kids chattering.] [Sighs.]"
S1e3,PETER:,"Lois, you won't believe this! Meg just said ""Da-Da!"" Her first words? Then she stood up by herself and started walking! - Her first steps? - Yeah. What the hell are you doing in here anyway? [Drums playing.]"
S1e3,PETER:,"All right! Her first drum solo. [Applause.] Thanks to Cheesie Charlie l'm not gonna miss a moment of Stewie's party. I say, am I to spend the entire day wallowing around in my own feces? A little service here! Hey, Stinky. Have we got some big plans for you. Plans? What the devil are you talking about? It's your birthday, dude. Saturday's gonna be real special, honey. I've hired a professional to make sure everything goes just right. A professional? There's treachery afoot! [Crying.] Meg, you're home late. I stayed after school to try out for cheerleading. Don't keep me in suspense. How'd you do? I'll give you a hint. I S-U-C-K-E-D! Sucked! Yay! I mean, sorry, honey."
S1e3,MEG:,"God, I hate high school. I don't fit in with anyone. Boy. Do I know that feeling. [Suspenseful, jazzy instrumental music.] Okay, man. Okay. You are really throwing me off. It's step-kick, step-twirl. Got it? I thought we were gonna rumble with those greasy Sharks. Not without seven years of ballet and two of jazz tap, we're not. From the top, people! Why don't you just hang back and stretch? I don't get it. The more I try to make friends, the more people hate me. Listen. You're a one-of-a-kind girl with a mind of her own. - Now, see, that's what people hate. - Really? I'm telling you, just be the girl you think everyone else wants you to be. Wow, it's so obvious. Thanks, Daddy."
S1e3,MEG:,"Hi, Mom. Bye, Mom."
S1e3,LOIS:,"I haven't seen Meg this happy since that bus broke down in front of our house. Hi. Can we use your phone? Holy crap! It's The Children of the Corn! - Meg and I had a little father-daughter talk. - It seems to have worked. I wasn't just blowing smoke when I bought this T-shirt. Well, you're the number-one husband, too. I know. That's why I bought this T-shirt."
S1e3,STEWIE:,"""Dear Diary ""It seems the domestic overseers are plotting against me. ""Their plans somehow relate to the anniversary of my escape from the womb. ""I'm still haunted by the memories of how I was incarcerated ""in that amniotic Attica. [Epic instrumental music.] ""As I recall, it was every potential man for himself. [Whooshing.] ""I alone had reached the target objective, thanks to the intrepidity ""I developed at testicular boot camp. But it was a trap!

S1e3,PETER:,"Hong Kong Phooey! Yeah! Come on! Go, yeah! Eat my dust!"
S1e3,PETER:,"Come on, move it! Oh, man! Chris, this place is great. Pull over, you bastard! Pull over, you bastard! Man."
S1e3,CHRIS:,"Hey, Dad, they even got games in the bathroom. Look, I won a balloon! Yeah, way to go, Chris. Where's my watch? All right. I won a watch. What's The Dukes of Hazzard? That's mine. Come on. Come on, give that back! - Give it! - Come on! UNCLE"
S1e3,JESSE:,"Folks in Hazzard County hadn't seen a watch fight in a long time. Them boys rassled for a full five minutes before the manager stepped in. Come on! Hands off, fatty! Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I'm a paying customer. I got a deposit check for my kid's party right here. Mr. Griffin. I am terribly sorry. We're really looking forward to Stewie's special day. Now I don't know, after the emotional trauma I've endured on your premises, I think I deserve a little discount. Sir, our prices are set by the corporate office. Then maybe I'll just take my business elsewhere. Good luck filling our spot by this Saturday."
S1e3,MAN:,I got cash!
S1e3,WOMAN:,"I'll take it! Suit yourself. Wait. I was just bluffing. My wife has her heart set on this place. [Peter yells after him.] Chris, this is a big day for you. The day you become the man of the house. Because when we get home, your mother is going to kill me. So the man in white is coming to put me back in the womb, is he? If I'm to defeat him, I shall require professional forces."
S1e3,STEWIE:,"Here we are. ""Come to Managua, the Mecca of mercenaries."" I must prepare for my journey. Let's see. Grenades, mace, baggy full of Cheerios - So, are we all set at Cheesie Charlie's? - Actually, I canceled the reservation. What? - How could you? - Lois, I got a very good reason. Wait a second. These are always classic. Lois, that Cheesie Charlie's is no good. See, it happened like this. [Spooky instrumental music.] [Screaming.] Welcome to Cheesie Charlie's. Heil, Hitler! Actually, the name's Griffin. I was sent by my smart, beautiful, and still sexually appealing wife, Lois. Yes. We're all set for your little boy's party. I understand we're getting a terrific bargain here. Absolutely. The children get to play our games. And if they win enough tickets, they get a prize. I have 13 tickets now. Is that enough? Sorry, Timmy. But you need 15 tickets to live. [Screaming.] They also get food, cake, and your choice of ice-cream flavors vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, or people. - What was that? - Chocolate. Give me the check. Hold it! Lois may have had her heart set on this place but I love my family too much to risk their lives. - Come on, Chris. We're leaving. - No, you're not! Please don't make me angry, pal. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry. [Eerie instrumental music.]"
S1e3,LOIS:,"All right, Peter. That's enough! Bravo, Peter. You are the Spalding Gray of crap. Do you know how hard it was to get a reservation at Cheesie Charlie's? I had to book it the day of my ultrasound. We'll never find another place in time! For once, it was all gonna be so perfect! Come on, Lois. It'll still be perfect. We'll give him the best birthday ever right here in the safety and comfort of our own home. - Peter, we've been over this. - Honey, you won't have to lift a finger. I got us a clown, a cake, a petting zoo, a big-ass piñata, the works! - You got all those things? - You bet I did."
S1e3,LOIS:,"Wow. Even Cheesie Charlie's doesn't have a petting zoo. Okay, I'll call the parents and let them know the party's here. - You don't have any of those things. - How do you know? Face it. You're a terrible liar. [Sniffing.] It was you. Clowns and petting zoos book months in advance. You're gonna have a tough time finding a Hold on."
S1e3,DRIVER:,"Ya! Ya! [Horses neighing.] Some day. Hey there, little boy. Are you lost?"
S1e3,STEWIE:,"Now, listen to me, Jolene. I've got an army to raise, and I must get to Nicaragua. I require a window seat and an in-flight Happy Meal. And no pickles! - God help you if I find pickles. - Henry, I have a lost little boy. Hey there, little fella. Why don't you come with me?"
S1e3,STEWIE:,"Damn you! You're one of them, aren't you? What are they paying you? I'll double it! I'll give you whatever you want! Money! Women! Men? Dad, what are we doing here again? Pigs, Chris. We're getting pigs for Stewie's petting zoo. [Blower starting.] [Pig squealing.] [Pigs squealing.] [Motor stopping.] Crafty swine. UPS. Little bastards ain't as smart as Hi, Mom. This is Jennifer. She gave me a ride home. Meg, you made a friend."
S1e3,JENNIFER:,"What a lovely house, Mrs. G. Meg, you didn't tell me your mother was just like Martha Stewart. Oh, no. Once you get to know me, I'm really very nice. You know what's nice? Having a friend like Meg. And kittens. It was super swell meeting you. Bye, Meg. Friends forever. Forever and ever. [Giddy laughter.] Wow! What a great yard! Guess what, Mom? Jennifer invited me to a party on Saturday. This Saturday? Meg, you can't miss Stewie's first birthday."
S1e3,MEG:,"But Mom Meg, our entire family is going to be here for Stewie's party. And that includes you. Understood? I can't believe you'd put your family before your own daughter! She's a whiny little runt, isn't she? I said ""runt."" I don't think I'm in the right place. I'm looking for a guy to entertain the kids at my son's birthday. Sure. I can do that. You do children's parties? Yeah. I can do, like, a handstand, and some somersaults maybe. I can make pretend like the children are little bugs in my web. Do you know your phone number, son? The only way you'll get me to talk is through slow, painful torture. And I don't think you've got the grapes! It sounds like you don't want to go home. Are you running away? Stewart Gilligan Griffin runs from nothing! You know, son, running away never solves anything. You're getting to be a big boy now. And part of growing up means facing your problems head on. The ruptured capillaries in your nose belie the clarity of your wisdom. You're saying I must return to face this man in white myself. So be it. As for you, kind sage, I only hope my heartfelt thanks will keep you warm as you spend the next 10 years in frozen carbonite! Peter, you've only got a couple of hours left. If you pull a party out of your ass, you'll want to stand up. My friend Jennifer invited me to hang out with her friends. Can I go? I won't fall for this trick. Did you ask your mother? Yes. Okay, then. Have fun, sweetheart. Thanks, Daddy! Brian, Stewie's birthday is gonna suck. The only stuff I could get on such short notice was a cake and that big-ass piñata. I sure hope candy comes out of that. Face it, Brian. I'm a bad father, a lousy husband, and a snappy dresser. I'll never be able to face Lois. The circus is in town. Maybe you could run away and join it. The circus! [Marching band playing.] [Elephant trumpeting.] Hi. This is the right day, isn't it? Oh, yes. Peter should be back any minute and then we can start the party, I hope. Hey, Lois, look. The two symbols of the Republican party an elephant and a big fat white guy who's threatened by change."
S1e3,LOIS:,"Peter, this is the most wonderful celebration I could have imagined."
S1e3,PETER:,"Yeah. Where's Stewie? He's upstairs, resting up for his big day. [Oriental instrumental music.] I'll get him. If you see Meg, tell her to take plenty of pictures. Meg's not here. She went to a friend's house. What? She's gonna miss Stewie's birthday. I dropped her off an hour ago. Boy, is she gonna be sorry, or what? Peter. How could you let her go? What's the big deal? So Meg's with her new friends. They seemed like some nice kids."
S1e3,JENNIFER:,I'm glad you could join us. We're gonna have a great time on our trip. A trip? Like to the beach? Because I didn't bring my swimsuit. You won't need anything where we're going. Excuse me. I've gotta go mix the punch. [Whimsical music playing.] [Whimsical music playing.]
S1e3,CHRIS:,"Birthday dude? Do you want some ice cream? Yes. But no sprinkles! For every sprinkle I find, I shall kill you! Come on, Lois. I hate to see you so upset. We got animals. We got clowns. I mean, a party couldn't be any better if Jesus himself showed up. Okay, everybody. For my next miracle, I'm gonna turn water into funk. [Disco music playing.] Peter, the circus is terrific. But it's not just Stewie's birthday. We're also celebrating the day our family became whole. Today means nothing if Meg isn't here. Meg, you seem sad. Today's a happy day. I know. It's just that I really like that guy over there. But he doesn't even know I exist. He must think I'm a total dog. That is so not true. Then what is it? - He's a eunuch. - Really? Sure. All the guys here have been castrated. It's cool. - Do you think that girl is hot? - No. Me neither. [Elephant trumpeting.] Hey, you. Hit me. There. Now, if I can just find a midget with some gin, I'll be in business. Where are you off to? I gotta make things right for Lois and get this monkey off my back."
S1e3,PETER:,"Ow! Knock it off! All right, men, the man in white is coming to put me back in the womb. Today he comes for me, but tomorrow it could be you or you! I offer you the opportunity to join me in glorious battle. I know that for some of you, your motor skills are not developed. Sadly, you will be used as decoys. Sadly, you will be used as decoys. But your children's children will know that you fell for a noble cause. Now, who's with me? Duckie? Useless, every one of you! Fine. I'll defend myself, and the hell with all of you! There, I've gone and soiled myself. Are you happy now? [Gong goes off.] Our leader is here to take us on our journey! My children, rejoice. The hour of transformation is close at hand. Who are you? This is Meg, wise one. Can she come with us? Perhaps. Do you have a mind that seeks enlightenment and a heart that seeks purity? Not really. Okay. Are you a confused adolescent desperately seeking acceptance from an undifferentiated ego mass that demands conformity? Wow, that sort of sounds more like me. Great! Then all you need is a dark-blue jogging suit. Let's see what we have in stock. What are you? About a 9? No. A 6. Right. Dispense the refreshments. Meg, there you are. Dad, what are you doing here? I'm so embarrassed, I could die!"
S1e3,GUY:,"Not before the rest of us! Meg, your mother wants the family together today. It's just Stewie's birthday. So what if I'm not there? Who's gonna remember? Your mom will, trust me. She remembers everything. In fact, she always says the best memories she has are when you kids were born. Meg, that's it. This day is more for your mom than it is for Stewie. With all she's given us, she oughta get whatever she wants. And, Meg, today she wants you to be with the family. Really? Daddy, you must think I'm the worst daughter ever. No you're not, honey. What about that fat girl from the Judds? I'm sorry I've been so selfish. TEEN 1: I miss my mom. TEEN 2: Me, too. I also miss my nads. Mr. Griffin, can we come to Stewie's party, too? Sure. The more the merrier. Meg, you have the coolest family. She sure does. Here's to family! To family! Jeez, look at the time! Come on. Come on, kids. Let's get going. [Bodies falling over.] Sorry, Meg. It's another bunch of people that'd rather fake death than go to a party with you. Children, the time of ascension has arrived. For the love of God. Haven't any of you ever been in a cult before? Damn it! I can't achieve transcendence by myself. That would just make me some kind of lone nut. Somebody's got to die with me. Come back, Meg! Whoops. Can't forget my ceremonial white robe. I guess there's nothing left but the birthday cake."
S1e3,MEG:,"Right here! Meg! I'm sorry, Mom. Thank you, Peter. No problem. I cannot wait to taste this cake. The guy who sold it to me said it was delicious and erotic. Peter, there's a naked man on this cake. There were only two left. And trust me, you did not want the one of Al Roker with the Hershey Kiss nipples."
S1e3,LOIS:,"Gather round, everyone. It's time for Stewie's big moment. [Knocking.]"
S1e3,LEADER:,Hello? Is anybody home?
S1e3,STEWIE:,"Greetings, man in white. I've been expecting you. Who said that?"
S1e3,STEWIE:,Peek-a-boo! I see you! You're getting warmer. Where are you? What do you want?
S1e3,STEWIE:,Freedom! What do you want? I want to get the hell out of here!
S1e3,STEWIE:,"I'm sorry. We're fresh out of that. I'm afraid all that's left is untimely death. [Dramatic instrumental music.] What the hell is this? It's a boy! [Energy pulsing.] Anybody seen Stewie? Yeah. Where is the birthday boy? Victory is mine! Yes. And this cake is yours, too. Stewie, make a wish. If you blow out the candle, it'll come true. That's right, little buddy. What do you want most in the whole world? In the whole world, you say? [Bombs whistling.] [Troops marching.] [Bombs exploding.] What the hell.

You're just teething, Stewie. It's a normal part of a baby's life. Very well then, I order you to kill me at once! Honey, I know you're hurting. But Mommy has to clean up the house, all right? No, it's not all right! For the love of God, shake me! Shake me like a British nanny! Oh, man. This is the life. Hand me another one of them Pawtucket Patriots.

That's even more humorous than that joke you told us last night. Okay, so a Jewish guy and a Chinese guy walk into a bar, right? Wait a second. Jewish guy and a Chinese guy walk into a bar. And there's a naked priest sitting there. And he Oh, sorry, Father. No, I've heard them all. Look at the time. I promised Loretta I was gonna trim the hedges and be tender with her. Believe me, Cleveland. Our wives need some time off as much as we do. This is when Lois does all those little things that women like to do. [Grunting.] [Car honking, Lois sighs.] I'll be on your bed. No calls."
S1e4,PETER:,"Hey, Lois. You've been busy all day. So I took care of dinner. Really? All you gotta do is gut it, clean it, scale it, and cook it."
S1e4,LOIS:,"I spent all morning cleaning up the house. And in five seconds, you turn it into low tide at the pier. Jeez. I'm sorry, honey. I'd help you clean it up. But you know how lousy I am with housework. Remember when I tried doing the laundry? Let's see. Shirts, pants I'm missing another sock. Welcome to Narnia. I'm Mr. Tumnus. Give me back my sock, you goat bastard!"
S1e4,PETER:,Hey! You're right. It's better if I do it.
S1e4,STEWIE:,"Damn it to the bowels of bloody hell! The baby's up. Can you get him? Okay. I hope he doesn't need changing. I'm a little gun-shy after what happened last time. No, you imbecile! That's not talc! That's paprika! Take that! All right, I'll do that, too! Can you at least take Chris to his game? Jeez, Lois. I spent all morning on a boat drinking beer, telling jokes, and screwing around. How about a little me time? Honey, I'm begging you. Drop Chris off at his soccer game and come right home. I need you to look after Stewie while I'm teaching piano lessons, please! All right! You know I spoil you."
S1e4,CHRIS:,"Thanks for the ride, Dad. All right. Have fun, Chris. Hey, Petey! Quagmire? What are you doing here? Soccer moms! [Soccer moms giggle.] All right. I'd like to hang around with you. But Lois needs me at home. I got beer."
S1e4,PETER:,"Boo, Lois! Yay, beer! [Playing classical music.] [Lois shushing.] It's okay, Stewie. Where the hell's Peter? That was good, Reuben. Now play Brahms' Lullaby. [Sings.] ""Lullaby and good night"" Enough! The only thing worse than the wretched pain in my mouth is the excrement spewing from yours! I wish I could make the pain go away sooner. But I can't turn time forward. Oh, no! Perhaps I can! Of course! I'll simply build a machine that can move time! I shall call it a time machine. E-flat, Salieri! E-flat!"
S1e4,PETER:,"Go, Chris! Daddy loves you! I mean in a platonic way. I'm married. [Whistle.] Hand ball! Penalty kick, blue! That's the 10th time today! Nice grab, orca. Get Moby Dick off the field before he burps up a license plate! Easy, fella. That's my kid. Now apologize. Okay. I'm sorry your kid's a brain dead stinking blue cheese feta! That's it! Way to go, Dad! You hit my mom! No, I hit your dad. Stand back. Give her some air. You mean, ""Give him some air."" Call an ambulance. She's going into labor. You mean, ""He's going into labor."" [Baby crying.] Whoops."
S1e4,PETER:,"I can't believe I punched a woman. A pregnant woman. I just hope she accepts my peace offering. I sent her a little something for the baby. [Melodic strumming from box.] I would've brought it over myself if I wasn't under house arrest. You're just fortunate this is your first offense, Peter. Could've been a lot worse if the cops knew about the other times I broke the law. And there was that time I took a whiz in public. And that time I snuck into Wimbledon. And that time I snuck into Wimbledon. Me and Cleveland are gonna ""amscray."" Wait. You guys can't leave me here alone. Why don't you come with us? I can't leave the premises. They're monitoring my every move. [Electronic beeping.]"
S1e4,PETER:,"I gotta get out of here! There's my little house husband. It's been so wonderful having you home all week. Thanks, honey. But I don't know how you stand it here all day. I mean, I'm so bored, I can't even watch TV anymore. All the shows are starting to run together."
S1e4,"NARRATOR:","This contains adult content and is brought to you by the letter ""H"". [Phone ringing.]"
S1e4,BERT:,"Hello? Son of a bitch. I'm on my way. Some poor bastard got his head blown off down at a place called Hooper's. Bert, I wish you wouldn't drink so much, Bert. Well, Ernie, I wish you wouldn't eat cookies in the damn bed! Bert, you're shouting again, Bert! [Comedic instrumental music.] I know you can't understand what I'm going through. All the stuff that makes you happy like cooking and cleaning, is right in the house just waiting for you. - You are one lucky - Stop now. Peter, I don't do those things because I enjoy them. I do them because I love my family. [Giggling.] Lois loves her family. Lois loves her family. ""Lois and the family sitting in a tree"" See, Lois, the guys would've found that hilarious. Why don't I go buy some groceries and make us a nice romantic dinner? Like when we were dating. That oughta take your mind off the guys. It already has. I wonder what the guys are up to? That's nasty. Where's the damn pull string? [Yells.] You never know what you're gonna find down here. [Dog barking, Peter yells.]"
S1e4,PATRIOT:,Peter!
S1e4,PETER:,"You're the Pawtucket Patriot. Verily. Come hither and give heed. Whoa. I don't swing that way, pal. Look, I got a date with my female wife. I just came down to get some beers."
S1e4,PATRIOT:,"Why spend time with your wife? If you build a bar in this basement and stock it with plenty of frosty Pawtucket Patriots your friends will come down here for a beer as well. Build a bar! That's a great idea. Wait. One last question. If I walk through you, does that mean, like, we've done it?"
S1e4,PATRIOT:,Jeez. What's with you and the gay jokes? [Cheerful instrumental music.] [Snoring.] [Lnstrumental music slows down.] [Sighs.] [Door opening.]
S1e4,LOIS:,"Where the hell have you been? We had a date. Sorry, honey. I must've lost track of the time. What do you say? You think the guys will like it? This is why you missed our dinner? To make a bar for your friends? Yeah, isn't it great? Oh, boy, I feel just like Tim Allen. I build stuff and I have a criminal record. [Macho grunting.] [Sniffing.] [Guys laughing.] Okay, guys. I got another one. What's the difference between pornography and art? [Chuckling.] Here it comes. A government grant. Peter, you are in the zone. You know those little clam cakes you make whenever we have company? I need about a dozen. Actually, better make it like 600. That's it, Peter! I'm not a servant. And I'm through taking care of you and your bar buddies! Jeez. Where the hell did that come from?"
S1e4,LOIS:,"Watch the kids. I'm taking a hot bath. Put me down, you blunderbuss! He's a little cranky from teething. I can fix that. [Mumbling.] Good God, man! One can only imagine what foul regions that finger has erstwhile probed! There you go. My mother used to use whiskey whenever I had a toothache. My tooth hurts!"
S1e4,PETER:,"There. How's that feel? It's delightful. [Bathwater running.] [Applause.] Thank you. Thank you very much. Lois, you are a wonderful woman. Words cannot express the depth of my appreciation and love for you. Peter! You must be Lois. No, not silicone. Silicon. And the design of the device is quite ingenious if I do say so myself, Misty. What a delightful moniker. You see, Misty [Stewie giggles.] my time manipulator employs axioms from the quantum theory of molecular propulsion. I've broken my pencil! I have a Barney pen in my purse. You are spectacular! Chris, what are you doing here? Sorry, Mom. I'm gonna need to see some ID. Chris, go to your room! Hello, Mother. Care to partake in one of your oh-so-exhilarating games of peekaboo? Oh, my God! My baby is drunk!"
S1e4,PETER:,"No, I'm not! Him? Yeah. He's a real lightweight. Meg, take Stewie upstairs. [Sings.] ""Show me the way to go home"" Everybody! ""I'm tired and I want to go to bed"" Just the women! Peter, in the 17 years that we've been married I have never been as angry as I What is my piano doing down here? It was supposed to be a clam cake buffet, but Never mind. That does it, Peter. Either this bar goes or I do!"
S1e4,PETER:,"I haven't even told you the other reason your piano's down here. I wanted you to play it. Like it was an instrument. I'm telling you the truth. Right, guys? Come on! I couldn't. Come on! Maybe one song. Pretend you like it no matter how bad it stinks. [Lois chuckles.] [Starts playing piano.] [Sings.] ""You'll never know just how much ""I love you ""You'll never know just how much I care"" Yeah! ""And if I try, I still ""couldn't hide my love for you ""You oughta know for haven't I told you so?"" Okay, guys. Thank you. You can stop pretending now."
S1e4,GUY:,"All right! ""If there is some other way to prove that I love you ""I swear I don't know how"""
S1e4,MAN:,"Sing it. Something troubling you, Peter? Nothing. Just all my friends are eye-humping my wife. ""You'll never know if you don't know now"" [Applause.]"
S1e4,GUYS:,"Wonderful! Wow! [Cheery instrumental music.] It was absolutely amazing. The second that spotlight hit me, I became a whole different person! Silence, you contemptible shrew! I bet your gums are still sore. You're so observant, aren't you? Are you a detective? Yes, my gums are sore! Enough of this! I must complete my time machine, move time forward, and end this agony!"
S1e4,CHRIS:,"Hey, Dad. Mom says she was really on last night. Yeah. About that. Lois, see, the guys were just being polite. They thought your singing was too I was just nervous. Tonight'll be better. Tonight? Honey, I don't think anyone's gonna come back tonight."
S1e4,LOIS:,"[Sings.] ""Gimme, gimme, gimme what I cry for ""You know you got the brand of kisses ""that I die for"" This one takes me back. Now that's a woman! That's a house. That's a fish. That's a bee! ""You know you made me love you"" I love you. Thank you. Thank you. Johnny Muldoon, ladies and gentlemen. [Band strikes up.] I was born in a little town called Quahog."
S1e4,FAN:,"We love you, Lois! [Lois laughs.] Let me finish the story, fellas. You don't want to be up all night. Or do you? ""Or do you?"" She's a smokin' little pistol, isn't she? Are you a woman? No. My house arrest is over, Brian. Round up the guys. Now that I'm a free man, we can do anything we want. The guys only want to do one thing. And that's ogle your wife. If Lois were my woman, I'd keep an eye on her. Then again, I'm the jealous type. Wow! Lois Griffin! I love your act. Nice melons. Listen, pal Peter, I'm holding melons. And her hooters ain't bad either! Now hang on a second there! Peter, I'm holding hooters. Sorry. No problem. Your wife's hot!"
S1e4,PETER:,"That's it! Your singing days are over. If I wanted to marry Lola Falana, I would have. Look, Lola. This whole thing is just going way too fast for me. For the last time, I'm not Lola! I'm Leslie Uggams! Peter, having me sing was your idea in the first place. I just wanted to keep my bar. I built that thing so my friends would come to see me, not you. Is that so? Let me tell you something. I love singing! And I will continue to sing! How dare you upset me this close to showtime! Lois. Watch where you're going, buddy. Griffin, I got a bone to pick with you. Listen, I don't want any more trouble. Thanks to your wife my husband hasn't been home all week! That singing hussy is destroying our marriages! [Women murmuring.] Yeah, then do something about it. Come to my basement tonight and drag your husbands out of there. Maybe we will. Yeah! Jeez, fella. Can't you take that outside?"
S1e4,LOIS:,"This next number is dedicated to my very supportive husband, Peter. Hit it! [Sings.] ""Don't tell me not to fly I've simply gotta ""If someone takes a spill it's me and not you ""Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade"" Oh, boy. Lois is pretty pissed, huh? Yes, your judgment lately has been rather You have crappy judgment anyway."
S1e4,STEWIE:,"This is intolerable! This foolishness is preventing me from completing work on Egads! The blueprints for my time machine! Those are for my eyes only! Thank you. Look everyone, Stewie drew a picture for his mommy. No! [Fan whistling.] Hold up the picture. Let's see. No! Nothing to see here."
S1e4,GUY:,"How cute. It's a time machine! No! It's a Blast, what the devil do children draw? It's a pheasant! A time machine. Sure. Here's where the flux capacitor goes. I can't wait to build one of these of my own. I'll not stand idly by while you abrogate my plans. You shall rue this day. Go on! Start ruing! Bye-bye, Stewie. Mommy will be upstairs to kiss you good night. Burn in hell! Hell. Hell has fire. And you know what else? [Sings.] ""It's got steam heat ""I got steam heat ""But I need your love to keep away the cold I got"" ANGRY"
S1e4,PARENT:,"All right, break it up! What's going on here? Your little peep show is over! We're taking back our men! Peep show? I just do this for fun. Look, all day long I scrub and cook and take care of my kids. And nobody cheers. No one even says thank you. But when the band starts playing and the music's flowing through me, I feel, I don't know, special. I guess you all think that's pretty silly. Not at all. You didn't tell us that part! Peter, you're behind all this? Yes. And you'll never catch me! [Giggles maniacally.] [Screams repeatedly.] I bet he also didn't tell you he never helps me around the house. Or takes me out to dinner. Or notices when I get my hair done. - Oh, no, that's just - My husband's the same way. So's mine. [People chattering.] Wow, this place is full of dead pigeons. I'm gonna go grab some ozone. Peter! There's a king in the cards! They saw my blueprints! What a grievous breach of security! Damn! What do to? Wait for it Yes! Instead of moving time forward to bypass this wretched teething it might just be possible to reverse time's heady flow and undo ever having drawn those damnable blueprints. - You'll never get away with this! - Silence! Lois, you make it sound like I don't appreciate you at all. Peter, when was the last time you told me you love me? You know I do. I want to hear it! Is that what this is all about? Run for your lives! Holy crap! Hot! [Explosion.] [Screaming.]"
S1e4,LOIS:,"There's no way out! At last! My time device is complete! Just one final adjustment. There. Now I shall negate ever having drawn those damnable blueprints. Blast! Jeez. We're screwed! Look, I promise if we get out of this alive l'm gonna help out around the house and say ""I love you"" every day. You mean it? I'm a changed man, Lois. A better man. And to think, if I hadn't taken Chris to his soccer game I never would've learned this valuable lesson. [People talking backwards.] [Mystical instrumental music.] [Backwards speech slowing.] Honey, I'm begging you. Drop Chris off at his soccer game and come right home. I need you to look after Stewie while I'm teaching piano lessons, please! All right! You know I spoil you. My foot! I can't walk! I guess you'll have to take Chris yourself. [Giggles.] - My device! My teeth! - I'm free! Free! I claim this mouth in the name of Incisor! I think not! Bicuspid! We meet again. - Have at you! - En garde! Shall we bite the tongue then? On three. One, two [Screams.] [Theme music.]"
S1e5,LOIS:,"Stewie, those books aren't for babies. Here. Watch the Teletubbies. How dare you! That book may hold the key to my enslaving of all mankind. Fuzzy. [Giddy laughter.] Tickle. God. The more I resist, the more intriguing they become! I can't look away!"
S1e5,TELETUBBIES:,"Again! Again! Yes! Yes! Again! Again! Dear God, please once more!"
S1e5,PETER:,"Sorry, Stewie. A&E Biography is doing the life of the other guy from Wham. I'm free! Free from the spell of those diabolical Teletubbies! Thank you. When the world is mine, your death shall be quick and painless."
S1e5,LOIS:,"[Singing.] ""It seems today that all you see ""is violence in movies and sex on TV ""But where are those good, old-fashioned values ""on which we used to rely? ""Lucky there's a family guy ""Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you ""all the things that make us ""laugh 'n' cry ""He's a family guy"" Attention, please. Tomorrow is softball practice. We have a lot of work to do for Saturday's game. Don't forget how badly we were humiliated last year by Pawtucket Joke and Novelties. [Raucous laughter.] [Peter giggles.] Look at those morons and their stupid glasses. Oh, man. I hate those guys. More than I hate spinach, traffic jams, and the last few years of M* A*S*H. When Alan Alda took over behind the camera and the show got all dramatic and preachy? Am I right? Who's with me? This year we will defeat those Pranksters with our secret weapon Guillermo. [Screaming.] Bravo! I hired Guillermo because I believe he'll be an asset to our company on and off the field. MR."
S1e5,WEED:,"You have impeccable credentials. I'm sure I can find a position for you somewhere. Back to work, people."
S1e5,PETER:,"Mr. Weed, I got a great idea for a new line of TV action figures. Facts of Life Transformers, huh? Watch the transformation. Cute as a button fat as a cow radioactive scorpion. Watch out, Mrs. Garrett. Here comes Blair. - I'll consider it. - He'll consider it! I got another one where Natalie's one of those spittin' lizards from Jurassic Park. [Applause on TV.] Pat, I would like to solve the puzzle. ""Go tuck yourself in."""
S1e5,PAT:,"You got it. Well, you were close, Dad. Yeah. I still can't believe we missed the phrase, ""My hairy aunt."" Come on, Brian. I gotta get to softball practice. Practice? I thought we'd go next door and welcome our new neighbors. No. I don't want anything to do with neighbors. Last guy who lived next door borrowed my toaster. Never saw it again. If that slut wants full custody of the kids, she's got it. [Short-circuiting.] Peter, they might be very nice people. ""Very nice people."" Yeah, that's what they always say. Then you open up the septic tank and Skeleton city! [Panting.] Pervert! Don't flatter yourself, honey. I don't have any sweat glands. MR."
S1e5,WEED:,"Okay, time for batting practice, my Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Boys. Guillermo, you're up. Unfortunately Johnson isn't here to pitch today. His wife is in labor. Oh, what? Is the baby coming out of him? Jeez, I'll pitch. I don't know what's more questionable, your pitching arm or Bill Clinton's integrity. Oh, how hard [Laugh track.] Oh, how hard can it be to pitch? - Okay. Take your base. - Somebody call 911. Tell them he is allergic to penicillin and white zinfandel! Idiot! If you don't find a ringer to replace Guillermo, you're fired! Man. What'll I do if I get fired? I'll have to go back to my old job as a Calvin Klein model. FEMALE VOICE 1: I don't wanna be like everyone else."
S1e5,MALE:,But I don't want to be different. FEMALE VOICE 2: I just want to be.
S1e5,PETER:,What was the name of the bad guy from Tron? This is gonna drive me nuts!
S1e5,LOIS:,"Moving is never easy on a family. Well, we are gonna miss the go-go-go pace of Providence. But with number two on the way, Joe thought it was time to move. And I can't say no to Joe. Ever. Quahog can be pretty exciting, too. Last week, someone lost an eye at Bingo. l-17. Darn it. [Screams.] I haven't played Bingo in years! Silence! Ever since you two met, you've done nothing but wax idiotic! I must escape this infernal babble! [Chuckles.] What a little explorer. Yes. He's so full of wonder. To be the Lindbergh baby right about now."
S1e5,BONNIE:,"Joe, you have to meet our new neighbor, Lois Griffin. It's a pleasure, Lois. Who's the little guy? This is Stewie. Honey, say hi to Mr. Swanson. You will bow to me."
S1e5,MEG:,Hi. I'm Meg. I live next door. I know. I've admired you in the garden from afar. - Will you go out with me? - I'd love to. [Romantic instrumental music.]
S1e5,CHRIS:,"Oh, he's gay."
S1e5,MEG:,"You wish! Get out of here, you mouth breather!"
S1e5,PETER:,"I'm as good as fired. Where the hell am I gonna find a guy as strong as Guillermo? One time I walked into the locker room, I swear he was bench-pressing Mr. Weed."
S1e5,PETER:,Great. Lois is getting chummy with the new neighbors.
S1e5,BRIAN:,She wants you to meet them.
S1e5,PETER:,"She's always making me be social. Cocktail parties, school functions, that time we planted trees in Jerusalem. What? Look, all I'm saying is put an Israeli guy next to an Arab guy and I can't tell the difference. - You must be Peter. Joe Swanson. - Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you, Phil. You got a neighbor on the other side of your house, too. So, don't think you always have to bug me. I'll keep that in mind. Say, do you have a screwdriver I can borrow? Man, you neighbors are like viruses. Starts with a screwdriver. Before you know it, you're using my supermarket my dry cleaner, and even my postman. Can you believe that guy? ""Do you have a screwdriver I can borrow?"" What an ass. - Did you find a replacement for the team? - No. Believe me, I've been looking. Hideo-san would be honored to play for your team. But he wishes to know what compensation you offer. Me love you long time. Gosh, I'd like to help. But I've gotta go out in the hall and chew on my ass for five minutes."
S1e5,LOIS:,"Peter, I invited Joe and Bonnie to your game on Saturday. Lois, I don't want those people there. See, this is why I ask you to submit everything to me in writing first. Bonnie told me Joe is a big baseball fan. He played in college. He did? Welcome to the neighborhood. Hiya, Joe. - Peter! - Don't get up. This is a surprise. I kinda thought you didn't like me. What? Because of what I said this afternoon. No. See I have that disease where stuff pops out of your mouth. Go to hell! Whoops. See what I mean? I'm so sorry. I thought maybe I crossed the line when I asked to borrow a screwdriver. Are you kidding? You can borrow whatever you want. Great. Say, you don't happen to have any picture wire, do you? Picture wire? You son of a bitch. [Dreamy ringing.] Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! There it goes again. I don't want to impose. No problem. That's what neighbors do. You know what else they do? They play on their neighbor's company softball team like this Saturday."
S1e5,PETER:,"What do you say, neighbor?"
S1e5,JOE:,"Sounds fun. So much fun it should be illegal like copyright infringement. [Mickey voice.] See you at the game, Joe. [Cheery instrumental music.] - Hey, you want a piece of gum? - Thanks. - That was joke gum. - What do you mean? Now you're addicted to heroin. I'm cold."
S1e5,LOIS:,"Hey, Peter! MR."
S1e5,WEED:,"It's nice that your family is here. If your ringer doesn't arrive soon, you can spend every day with them at home. He'll be here, Mr. Weed. You should see this guy in action."
S1e5,PETER:,"He can hit, he can throw"
S1e5,JOE:,Peter! MR.
S1e5,WEED:,"What's he doing in a wheelchair? Holy crip, he's a crapple! Peter, our new secret weapon is this very attractive paraplegic? Okay, Joe, you got me. Rise and shine. Come on. - Stand and deliver. Get the hell up. - You're a hoot, Peter. - Play ball! - Let's do it! I swear I didn't know. Maybe they won't hit a lot of balls to him."
S1e5,JOE:,"I got shortstop. The movers tracked grease all over my carpet. - I tried everything to get the stain out. - What about lemon juice? - What about club soda? - What about shutting the hell up? Isn't baseball great? They say baseball's the national pastime. I can't taste salt. Crap! Don't hit it to Joe. Please don't hit it to Joe! [Fans cheering.] You're out! All right, Joe! Way to earn that parking space!"
S1e5,BONNIE:,All right!
S1e5,LOIS:,Did you see that?
S1e5,BONNIE:,That's my Joe!
S1e5,STEWIE:,"What the deuce? Half man, half machine."
S1e5,STEWIE:,"Why with that technology, I could escape these wretched harridans! Go, cyborg! [Fantastical instrumental music.] MR."
S1e5,WEED:,"It all rests on that man's broad, rippling shoulders! [Whooshing.] MR."
S1e5,WEED:,"All right, Joe! Run! All right, Joe! Come on! Yeah! MR."
S1e5,WEED:,"Hurry! Joe! All right! Yes, vamos!"
S1e5,PLAYER:,"Let's hear it for Joe! Yeah, let's hear it for the guy who found Joe! Okay. That's finger suckin' good, huh? It's an old policemen's recipe. Eat up, everyone. Tonight my wife won't be the only one enjoying a pig in a blanket."
S1e5,BONNIE:,"Joe, you're so funny. They love that one down at the Precinct. This sucks, Brian. Joe is stealing my thunder. Hey, everybody! Time to limbo! - Face it. He's the life of the party. - Yeah? I'll show you who's the life of the party. Hey, look! I fell in the pool with my clothes on! How hilarious is that? That is so Peter Griffin. Guys? Guys?"
S1e5,JOE:,That's my idea. MR.
S1e5,WEED:,"Peter, come here. Finally. A little recognition. Joe has the most wonderful idea. Hey, I just suggested a line of handi-capable toys, you know to show kids the fun side of being physically challenged! That's what kids want to play with. Yeah. A Beanie Baby in a bubble. What about my idea? Come on! Tootie morphs into a stink bug. Joe, you're exactly the kind of man we need at our company. Peter, make yourself useful. Go get Joe a drink. Jeez, first he takes my friends. Then he takes my job. But the way I wear my hat No, no. He can't take that away from me. You! How came you by this metal construct? - I demand to know who made you! - Stewie, it's not polite to point. I'm so sorry. That's okay, Lois. He's just curious about the chair. About 10 years ago I was investigating a robbery at an orphanage."
S1e5,JOE:,"It was Christmas Eve and some presents had been stolen. [Tense instrumental music.] [Grunting.] Reach for the sky, dirtbag! All right, pal! You've stolen your last Christmas. [Exciting instrumental music.] ""You think you have won You think all is well ""But kiss my green ass I shall see you in hell!"" [Screaming.] Are you Timmy? Merry Christmas, Timmy. Enough! If you won't share your technological schemata with me peaceably I shall take the information from you by force! Wow. Looks like you have a fan. - Come on. Let's get out of here. - Peter, you can't leave. Sorry, I promised the wife and kids I'd take them on a dream vacation to Hawaii right now. Say aloha, kids. What are you talking about? We want to hear more of Mr. Swanson's stories. He's cool, Dad. He killed a guy. Well, technically he was killed by the state, but funny story. He did curse my name just before the injection."
S1e5,LOIS:,"Peter, what's the matter with you? Why are you guys making such a big deal over Joe? You don't admire wheelchair people. You're supposed to feel sorry for them. When did it become okay to be handicapped? Don't talk like that! He's a remarkable man and the rest of your family adores him! Fine. Then why don't you all marry him? And if he's so remarkable, let's see him do this. Hey, look at me. I'm walking. I'm a remarkable man. [People laughing next door.] Well, look who finally came home. I thought you were gonna spend all night at Joe's. I could've. That man has got magic fingers. He found this one spot behind my ear, I Forget about it. I thought my leg was never gonna stop. I don't believe this. My whole family worships the ground that guy can't walk on. It's not too hard to see why. He's a hero. He makes the world a better place. I've done lots of things to help people. Remember the time I sang to the kids at the Sunday school? Yes, you forgot the words. [Singing.] ""Jesus loves me ""He loves me a bunch ""Because He always puts Skippy ""In my lunch"" No. It's not the same thing. Joe puts himself in real danger every day. You're right. I'll never be that kind of hero. Unless I put myself in real danger, too! For my family's sake!"
S1e5,BRIAN:,Why are the pretty ones always so dumb? [Creepy instrumental music.] [Screaming.] [Cat squealing.]
S1e5,DISPATCH:,"Gang shooting on Third and Main. Three wounded, one dead. - Is it me or is rap music just getting lazier? - No. It's my new police scanner. This hero thing is gonna be easy once I find the right crime."
S1e5,DISPATCH:,Domestic disturbance
S1e5,PETER:,Boring!
S1e5,DISPATCH:,Report of a stabbing in
S1e5,DISPATCH:,"All units! A major robbery is in progress at Quahog Bank and Trust. Suspects are armed and extremely dangerous. - Perfect! Where's Lois and the kids? - Over at Joe's. Well, go fetch 'em. They're about to see a real hero in action. To the Batcave! [Adventurous instrumental music.] [Bats crying.]"
S1e5,PETER:,"Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!"
S1e5,PETER:,You thought Joe was something. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
S1e5,LOIS:,"Peter, what's the big rush? All right, you guys wait right here. Daddy's gonna make a little withdrawal. ROBBER 1: Give Tammy a round of applause. This was her first robbery and she was very brave. [Muted laugh.] Now before we go No, don't go. Oh, princess, we have to."
S1e5,PETER:,"I hope you brought your striped pajamas, boys. Because there's a five-year sleepover at the big house. And you're invited. ROBBER 2: You'll never take us alive! [Gunshots.] Lois and the kids should be in here to see this. Yes. It's going very well. Mom, what do you do when you like a boy but he doesn't even notice you? Meg loves Kevin. Shut up, you big sack of dog vomit! Meg, you're a sweet, lovely girl. He'll come around. Such a mom answer. Have you tried showing off the goods? How's that for a mom answer? Creepy. I saw some cute dresses down the street. If nothing else, it'll make you feel better. Come on, you guys."
S1e5,BRIAN:,"If you want to be a hero, now might be a good time. This isn't what I was expecting. I thought being a hero would be all fun and games. [Heroic instrumental music.]"
S1e5,PETER:,"Sorry, Wonder Woman. I got three kings. Now let's see your pair. [Wonder Woman sighs.] All right. Robin, what are you looking at me for? Look at her. [Space whooshing.] ROBBER 2: Come on. Let's go. Oh, perfect. ROBBER 2: We got hostages! Don't try anything funny! Don't worry, Brian. I got a plan. Good. I was afraid you were just gonna improvise. Actually, I was gonna use the little girl as a human shield and run like hell. But improvise, that'll be easier on my back. [Space whooshing.] Okay, in this improv, Tammy and the short robber are husband and wife."
S1e5,PETER:,Okay. And where are we?
S1e5,GUY:,A bar!
S1e5,MAN:,A pet store!
S1e5,GRANNY:,"Guadalajara, Mexico! Okay, okay. I heard pet store. And I'm the gruff but lovable owner. All right. Begin. Hello, married couple. I see you found a puppy. Yeah. His name is Sparky."
S1e5,PETER:,"Well, before you take Sparky home, let me check him for worms. Okay, drop it! All right, you guys. Let's get out of here."
S1e5,COP:,"All right, stand back! Whoa. Hang on. Sorry, no one can leave. Listen, the whole reason I saved you guys today was so I could be a hero. This wheelchair guy moved in next door and he can do all these great things and Your family idolizes the lousy cripple and not you? That's right! How'd you know? We've all been there."
S1e5,CHRIS:,Cool! The bank is getting jacked!
S1e5,LOIS:,"Officer, my husband's in there! - Can you tell me if he's okay? - What's he look like?"
S1e5,LOIS:,"He's wearing a white-collared shirt, kind of big, with glasses."
S1e5,COP:,I got him.
S1e5,LOIS:,"Oh, thank God. - Take him out. - No! Hey, there's my family. I just want you to know I rob banks because a deaf man stole my job at the phone company. So if anyone's gonna bust me, I'm glad it's you. [Tense instrumental music.] But But I was gonna be a hero. Nobody's going anywhere! Joe, it's Peter! He's in trouble! A failed robbery at Quahog Bank and Trust has led to a terrifying hostage situation. That's right. A hostage situation. - I gotta go. - I know. If we want the cops to take us seriously, we have to waste a hostage. But who? - Excuse me. Shouldn't that be ""whom""? - Okay, you. Crap!"
S1e5,JOE:,"This is Police Lieutenant Joe Swanson. I know we can work this out. Not him again. I hope this place isn't wheelchair accessible. Bonnie, it's Peter. Don't worry. Joe's an excellent negotiator. I was a virgin when we met. It took him three hours. I can't believe my dad is in there. This'll probably scar me for the rest of my life. I got a new dress. Try talking about him. So do you like music? Yeah! I played guitar in a band before we moved. But it interfered with my studies. What do you listen to? You first. I'm into Garbage, Phish, Blur. My parents don't like me listening to that stuff. But I do anyway because I am not a robot! I also like Radiohead. And even though society has turned its back on you I promise you there are people who care. And you know what? I'm one of them. He sure gets it. Maybe he's right. We can make a new start. Come on, guys. Don't let him sweet talk you like that. Wait. You can't leave now."
S1e5,PETER:,"I'm supposed to be the hero. Wait! Can you let me pistol-whip you a couple times for the camera? Stupid robbers with your guns and your make-out parties. [Crowd cheering.] [Cops cheering.] Excellent! They detached the human component from the machine. Machine, I am your new master and I order you to go! Engage! Blast! Must be some kind of proprietary command system. Now on the Russian MiG, it's next to the altimeter."
S1e5,LOIS:,"There you are. I can't turn my back on you for a second. One day I shall unlock the secret of that device. And when I do, Mother, victory shall be Peter, you had us so worried. What on earth were you trying to prove? I'm sorry. Joe is a great guy. I guess I was just tired of him being your hero. Peter, Joe is a hero. But he's not our hero. - You are. - Really? Yeah. You're always right there on the couch for us, making us laugh when we're upset. Changing the channel when something boring comes on. Eating the last slice of pizza so the rest of us don't fight over it. Yeah, Daddy. If you hadn't pulled this stunt I wouldn't know how to manipulate Kevin. And when the kids at school see us on TV they'll think you're a total psycho. And I can say, ""That psycho is my dad!"" I wouldn't have won silver in Nagano, had you not driven me to the ice rink every morning at 6:00 a.m. I guess being a hero isn't always about saving lives and catching bad guys. It's also about just being there for the people you love. OLD"
S1e5,WOMAN:,Help! Someone just stole my purse! Who cares? I don't even know you. [Theme music.]
S1e6,lS:,"[Singing.] ''lt seems today that all you see ''is violence in movies and sex on TV ''But where are those good, old-fashioned values ''on which we used to rely?

What do you want? l don't want to be in the Scouts anymore. l just want to draw. l was kinda hoping you could tell Dad. But try and open with a joke. Tell him yourself. l can't. l don't want to disappoint him again. You remember when he tried to sneak me into the County Fair? One, please. [Chris sneezes.] Wait a second! Your ass just sneezed! And horses can't talk! No! Nothing about this adds up at all! Okay, look. Dad is really easy. All you have to do is sit on his lap give him a big kiss on the cheek, look him right in the eye, and he's butter. What the hell? Dad, the Scouts are no fun. And l. Wait a minute. Chris, l am going to stand up, walk out of this room and we will never speak of this again. [Moans.] [Exciting instrumental music.] Speed, you should not race! Ha-ha! The Mach 5 is not ready! Ha-ha! But Pops, l must race! Ha-ha! Very well. But l am not really your father! Ha-ha! [Exclaiming.] [Crowd cheering.] Okay girls, get ready [Scouts making revving sounds.] get set.

Look, Chris. lt's a whole family of WASPs. My, Margaret. What a sub-par ham. Perhaps l can't bake a ham. But what l can cook up is a little grace and civility at the table. Patty, did you know that your mother is a whore? l think it's great that you and Chris've been spending so much time together. But he's the one who should be earning that badge. Where do you get off telling me how to raise my son? Right. Okay. We'll try it your way, honey. [Laughing nervously.]"

Do you know what a vision quest is? Of course l do. l'm an lndian. But why don't you explain it to my wife? She's a little slow in the head. A vision quest is a sacred spiritual journey. Your husband must go out in the wilderness without food or water. -Or shoes. -Yeah. Or shoes. He must remain there until he can communicate with nature. He must hear the wisdom of the rocks and trees. And then his guiding spirit must appear to him and reveal a great personal truth. And it's gotta be a real vision. We're lndians. We're gonna know if he's lying. [Howling ominously.] [Laughing.] Sucker. LO"

[Screaming.] [Wolf growling.] They've been gone for over six hours. How long do these vision quests usually take? lt varies. lt depends on the person's age, and height, and sign. You have no idea, do you? Of course l. No. Why would you send my husband and son out into the wilderness without any food or supplies? Because we really like your car?

Just this morning you said they were lazy like the dirty Mexicans. Just kidding. The Mexicans are a clean and industrious people with a rich cultural heritage. Yeah. Not like those dumb, gargantuan Swedes. Actually, the Swedish people run the gamut from very short to tall. And did you know that Sweden gave us the brilliant inventor, Alfred Nobel? Yeah.

Today's competition will be almost as hot as the weather, which is once again in the triple digits. almost as hot as the weather, which is once again in the triple digits. [Bird squawks.] Peter, I'm not really comfortable with all this. Do I know you? I don't think I can do this. You can't back out now. How about a pill? - Something to relax you before you go on? - Peter, are you offering Brian drugs? Not drugs. Just a little blue thing celebrities take to help them perform. Well, those celebrities are wrong! Lois, if Liza is wrong, then I don't want to know what right is."
S1e7,STAGEHAND:,"Two minutes to curtain, Miss Minnelli! Come on, baby! Mama's gotta sparkle! It's time to make life a cabaret! Lady, for God's sake, I'm just a hard-shelled chocolate candy! Get help! [Grunting.] You there, child-woman! I'll give you a shiny dime if you'll roll me into the nearest lake. Let me see if I can find you a juice box. And get the lead out, pudgy!"
S1e7,ANNOUNCER:,"Next, Peter Griffin and his dog, ""Brain"". We're off to a good start. [Dramatic instrumental music.]"
S1e7,ANNOUNCER:,"A beautiful performance from ""Brain"" Griffin! Go, Brian! [Crowd applauding.] All right, Brian. We got it all sewn up. What the hell is this? This? This is the part where you beg for a treat. I don't think so. Brian, you're embarrassing me. God, he can't expect Brian to do that. It's easier than it looks, Mom. Come on, Brian. We had a deal. Yeah? The deal's off. Me and the little shred of dignity I have left will be waiting in the car! Brian, come! Don't you walk out on me! I now command you to leave. Keep going. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, flip me off. Good boy. [Giggling.] How could you let me down like that, Brian? I let you down? Because I refused to demean myself by perpetuating the stereotype of the good dog? This is the one thing I ever asked you to do for us. This and not do that thing where you drag your ass across the carpet. One time I did that! Peter, Brian, please. Let's just have a nice family car ride like we always do. Yeah. Except for the time Dad hit that deer. Yeah, it looks like it's just a ding. There's no reason to involve the insurance companies. I should still take down your information. Really? You could probably just buff that out. Yeah, but I I would really feel better if I got your information. Brian, maybe I had you pegged wrong. Maybe you really don't care about this family. If you cared about me, you'd never ask me to do something so degrading. The next time I ask you to do something, I expect you to do it. Understand? Who wants to sing show tunes? ""In old"""
S1e7,BRIAN:,Stop the car.
S1e7,PETER:,Is that what you want? Because I'll stop.
S1e7,BRIAN:,Pull over now.
S1e7,PETER:,"Fine. God. Brian, don't do this. Is the doggie going bye-bye? I'm so sad. Quick! Back up! [Sorrowful instrumental music.] Great. Is there a problem, Officer? Can I see your license, boy? ""Boy""? Oh, God. I left it on my other collar. - You been chasing cars tonight, boy? - Look, the name is Brian. - I was just out for a little walk. That's all. - Without a leash. I'm gonna have to ask you to lie down on the sidewalk. Down! I don't believe this. I don't suppose you could let us off with a warning? Sorry, sir. But leash laws are for his own good. The fine is $10. You behave, little fella, you hear me? [Slave voice.] Lordy, I'll never roam again! Jackass. He's the law outside this house just like I'm the law inside this house. - And you better start obeying both of us. - Look at you. Big man, can't even afford to buy an air conditioner for your family. What a bitch."
S1e7,DIANE:,"Good morning Quahog. The heat wave has finally broken. It sure has. You know what they say, ""If you don't like ""the weather in New England, go back where you came from."" I don't think that's the expression. I guess I had too many bloody marys this morning. But anyway [Belching.] God. I hope the boss isn't watching. [Laughing.] I don't know how those two manage to be so perky in the morning. Something smells good. Homemade cinnamon buns fresh from the tube. [Giggling.] Nothing says ""I love you"" like something from What the hell are you doing, you crazy bitch? These oughta cheer Brian up. Cinnamon buns are his favorite. Really? I could've sworn his favorite was ""treat Peter like crap"" buns."
S1e7,LOIS:,"Good morning, Brian. My, your summer coat is really coming in nicely. Isn't it, Peter? Yeah. Must be that special jojoba shampoo I bought you. It cost a little extra. But I would do anything for you, Brian. I'll be on the veranda since you're already on the cross. Eat with us, Brian. I made cinnamon buns. May I have one on a plate or is Peter planning to balance it on my nose? Peter, Brian, stop this. Can't you two go back to the way you used to be? [Ragtime music playing.] We can't go back to the way things were after how I was treated. - Not after the things I've seen. - What did you see? Was it breasts? Get over it, Brian. I mean, how bad do you really have it here? - When I found you, you were just a stray. - You swore you would never speak of that. No, thank you. I just had it cleaned. No. Jeez. All set, sir. I don't have any change. Sorry. That's okay. No charge. [Sad instrumental music.] Wait. [Stammering.] You hungry? Because my wife makes this beef-a-roni casserole. Out of this world. Look, you got everything you could possibly want right here. Now just eat your cinnamon bun and stop being a bad dog. How dare you? How dare I? Where do you think you're going? Out! You're not going anywhere without your leash! I don't need your damn leash, or you! I'm going for a walk. Don't worry. He won't get far without this. And a pack of Eldorados, unfiltered. What? That. Yeah. I'll clean that up on my way out. See that sign? Now why don't you go tie yourself up to that parking meter? I don't want any trouble. Mom, have you ever had a problem with freshness? What do you mean, honey? You know. Have you ever felt not so fresh? I'm not sure what you're I don't follow you. Have you ever felt like you're dirty? Down there? [Exclaiming.] God, no! That was Brian's favorite commercial. ""Brian""? No, it's not ringing a bell. Stop it! We all miss him. Go find him, apologize, and bring him home. You heard him. He doesn't want to be a part of this family. We don't need him. We'll get another pet. No way, Dad. No one can take Brian's place."
S1e7,STEWIE:,"Silence! That mongrel is probably decomposing on the side of a dirt road as we speak! - Let's get a kitty! - See, gang? Stewie's got the right idea. - I don't know, Peter. - Lois, trust me. We'll get a lovable kitty-cat and everybody will feel a lot better. [Hissing.]"
S1e7,PETER:,"Here, kitty, kitty. Come on down nice and easy. That's a good kitty. [Gasping.] What the hell was that? Something near a window. Preferably a booth. Yeah, you got 50 Puerto Ricans in the kitchen! Yeah, that's authentic Italian."
S1e7,BRIAN:,"Don't do that. That's what they expect you to do. Okay, fine for you. But what about your puppies? And your puppies' puppies? Am I the only one who's outraged here? I'm sorry. Enjoy your dinner. How come you're still setting a place for Brian? Because when he comes home, I want him to know he never left our thoughts. I know you're thinking about him, too, Peter. Look, Lois, he broke his promise to me. Besides, we have a new pet. And we love our fluffy kitty. Gross. Did he just drink from the fountain? Hey, you!"
S1e7,COP:,"Stay! [Dramatic instrumental music.] [Shouting.] Joyce DeWitt? So that's where you've been. Sorry, pooch. You gotta sleep outside. No dogs allowed in the bus station. My blind guy's in the john. I'll point him in your direction."
S1e7,PETER:,"Brian's tennis ball. Man, he loved to play with this thing."
S1e7,REFEREE:,"Double fault! Come on, Brian. Peter, why don't you just admit you miss Brian? You're right, Lois. Who am I kidding? This family needs Brian. I need him. [Cat howling.] God, I hate this freaking cat. Can you spare some change? Why? So you can go buy yourself another bottle of booze? Why don't you make something of your life, like this dog? That's me! I mean, that was me."
S1e7,MAN:,"Yeah, sure. No, I mean it. That was me. Get away from me, you crazy animal! You want me to be a crazy animal? Okay, I'm a crazy animal! Stop! Help! Help!"
S1e7,BRIAN:,"All right, who wants to be next? You? You? Brian!"
S1e7,PETER:,I'm here to bring you
S1e7,COP:,"You're going downtown, pal. home. Hi. How's it going? Oh, God. I know karate! [Kung fu noises.] [Dog growling.] Look! A tasty little baby! I see somebody's been neutered. Come on, sugar. It's time. Thank God. He's cute. Aren't you precious? Lethal injection. Next! - What? - Oh, no! You can't do this! Who's up for a little lunch? Something festive. Did someone say Tex-Mex? I'm sorry, sugar. Help me. Don't worry. I'll get you out of this. I'll get us the best help there is."
S1e7,PETER:,"""Dear MacGuyver ""Enclosed is a rubber band, a paper clip, and a drinking straw. ""Please save my dog."" You're looking well. Don't get too close. They say I'm dangerous. That's why the man's gonna put me down. Don't say that, Brian. Peter is working on your appeal. You'll see. Everything's gonna work out. I may have been born with my eyes closed, but now I see the world for what it is. I'm a second-class citizen, Lois. Great news! The City Council agreed to hear your case!"
S1e7,BRIAN:,"You're kidding! If I prepare my case, I might have a chance after all. I don't know how to thank you. We're family. This is what we do for each other. Right, Peter?"
S1e7,LOIS:,"Peter, don't stare! [Lntense instrumental music.] Good luck, sweetness. Thanks, Felicia. This meeting was called to review the judgment in City of Quahog v. Brian Griffin. Justice, for all? Or for some? Does a dog not feel? If you scratch him, does his leg not shake? Yes, he is man's best friend. But what manner of friend is man? I would like to cite the case of Plessy v. Ferguson Wait a minute. Why are we listening to a dog? Take him away! Does not every dog have his day? Wait! Please! I gotta say something! Look, all Brian's ever wanted is the same respect he gives us. That and Snausages. He's mental for those Snausages. And sure, sometimes we have arguments, like when he's sleeping on the bed and Lois is in the ""oodmay"" but Brian won't ""amscray."" - Peter - Okay. Look. The point is, he's a member of our family first and a dog second. And I'm real sorry I forgot that, buddy. Sometimes we all need a second chance. Sometimes we all need to forgive! I stole $10 from Meg's room! I stole $10 from Mom's purse! I've been making counterfeit $10 bills for years. Mr. Griffin, this dog is a danger to society. Albeit an articulate and charismatic one. But the law is the law and can't be circumvented by pretty words. I'll give you each $20. Deal. He can go. [All cheering.]"
S1e7,STEWIE:,"Mistrial, damn you! Mistrial! [Triumphant instrumental music.] No. Let him go. Anybody want more pizza rolls? Yeah. Quiet, Lois. Murder She Wrote. Charles Montrose, after all these years. Jessica Fletcher! Why I haven't seen you since you had the You can say it, Charles. I'm not ashamed. Abortion. So she's the murderer! Come on, kids. Bedtime. Good night, Brian. And welcome home."
S1e7,CHRIS:,"Good night, you guys."
S1e7,MEG:,"Good night. - Dog? - Yeah? If you ever tell anyone about that, I will kill you. [Theme music.]"
S2e1,LOIS:,"[Singing.] ""It seems today that all you see ""is violence in movies and sex on TV ""But where are those good, old-fashioned values ""on which we used to rely? ""Lucky there's a family guy ""Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you ""all the things that make us ""laugh 'n' cry ""He's a family guy"" Mother, this hot dog has been on my plate for a full minute and it hasn't yet cut itself."
S2e1,LOIS:,"Honey, I'll be right there. By all means, take your time. When you do finally get around to it, I'll be the one covered in flies with a belly that protrudes halfway to bloody Boston!"
S2e1,MEG:,"Mom, there is no way I'm sleeping in Chris' room this weekend! It smells like old milk in there! If I could find it, I'd clean it up! Kids, keep it down. I haven't even told your father that Aunt Marguerite is coming to visit."
S2e1,PETER:,Who said Marguerite?
S2e1,LOIS:,"Peter, it's just for a week. A week! No. Please, God, kill me now. Damn, crap, damn it to hell, son of a"
S2e1,LOIS:,"Peter! Lois, sometimes it's appropriate to swear. Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. You bastard. I love Aunt Marguerite. Because if it wasn't for her, I never would've met you, Peter."
S2e1,LOIS:,"Aunt Marguerite, have you seen my towel? Have the towel boy bring you another. I don't want to bother him. Nonsense, dear. You're a Pewterschmidt. Towel boy! [Dreamy instrumental music.] Hi, my name is towel. I have a Peter for you. My name is Peter. I'll be your nipples Towel boy! Oh, jeez. [Doorbell ringing.] Okay, everyone. Give Aunt Marguerite a big Griffin family welcome."
S2e1,LOIS:,"Aunt Marguerite! Lois! Oh, my God! She's dead! Whoa! Be careful what you wish for, huh, Lois?"
S2e1,CHRIS:,"What if they bury her and she wakes up because she wasn't really dead she was only sleeping? Yeah. That's what happened to our big brother Jimmy. That's why Mom and Dad adopted you. What? Peter, you remember Coco, my friend from Newport? Peter, I almost didn't recognize you without a towel on your arm. Lois, where are your parents? Don't tell me they're still on safari. You know Daddy. He won't rest until he kills something on every continent. But I'm hoping they'll be back in time for Christmas. It just wouldn't be Christmas without your parents. I dropped my watch. Would you be a sport and fetch it for me? Sure thing, Mr. Pewterschmidt. [Screaming.] Peter, we've got to put that out! I'm telling you, Brian, nothing changes. These bluebeards still treat me like scum 'cause I'm not loaded. I got news for them. I'm as elegant as anyone in this room."
S2e1,LOIS:,"We have to meet with Aunt Marguerite's lawyer tomorrow. She left us something in her will. Holy crap! You sweet old broad, I love you! [Mourners gasping.] [Peter humming.] Oh, my God. She's dead. Madam Pewterschmidt's passing has saddened us all. Yeah, it's a real tragedy. What did we get? Come on, big money! No whammy! Stop! Peter, please! I'm sorry. He's stricken with grief. Before she passed, your aunt recorded a message for you. ROBIN"
S2e1,LEACH:,"Newport, Rhode Island home of New England's most elegant and historic estates the Breakers, Rosecliff, and exquisite Cherrywood Manor the palatial mansion of Marguerite Pewterschmidt. Marguerite is a shining example of how people with a lot of money are just plain better than everyone else."
S2e1,MARGUERITE:,"Lois, you were always my favorite niece. I just knew you'd find a wonderful man who would make all your dreams come true. But I was wrong. And now you're dead. Score one for Peter. It's time you started living like a Pewterschmidt. That's why I'm giving you my summer home in Newport. Cherrywood? That's so generous of Aunt Marguerite. Our own summerhouse! Now I feel bad for doing that thing with her toothbrush. [Broadway showtune music.]"
S2e1,STAFF:,"[Singing.] ""We only live to kiss your ass"" Kiss it? We'll even wipe it for you."
S2e1,STAFF:,"""From here on in, it's Easy Street"" - Any bars on that street? - 24 happy hours a day. Oh, boy. ""We'll stop Jehovahs at the gate"" Can I see that pamphlet, sir?"
S2e1,PETER:,"""My God, this house is freakin' sweet [Music continues.] ""I make brunch, Clive cooks lunch ""each and every day ""Chocolate cake à la Blake ""Hundred bucks, Blake is gay ""We'll do the best we can with Meg"" Are you saying I'm ugly? It doesn't matter, dear. You're rich now. ""We'll do your nails and rub your feet"" That's not necessary. Oh, my. ""We'll do your homework every night"" It's really hard.

S2e1,STAFF:,"Welcome! That's a wrap, people. Let's get the hell out of here. Wait. Where are you going? The old bag only paid us up through the song."
S2e1,LOIS:,"We can just pick up after ourselves. After all, we'll only be here on weekends. No, Lois. It's time you started living like the Piece of Schmidt you are. That's ""Pewterschmidt""!"
S2e1,PETER:,"Wait, you guys. You're all hired to be full-time Griffin servants. Peter, where are we gonna get the money to pay all these people? Simple. I sold our house in Quahog. You sold our home? Surprise! Peter, how could you? Whoops. [Singing.] ""I recognize that tone ""Tonight I sleep alone ""But still, this house is freakin' sweet"""
S2e1,LOIS:,"Peter, how could you sell our house in Quahog without even asking me? Honey, this is where you belong. You deserve a big house and nice stuff. Like diamonds. [Classical instrumental music.] But I love our old house. You have to buy it back. It's too late. Our stuff is packed. It's on its way here. Come on, Lois, you'll love living in Newport. Sure, this house is big, but it's also very intimate. [Echoing.] Intimate."
S2e1,MEG:,"So we're really gonna live here now? That's right, honey. I don't know, Peter. Please, Mom. Look, there's a pool."
S2e1,CHRIS:,Yeah. And there's a chair.
S2e1,BUTLER:,The solarium is at the far end of the west wing.
S2e1,TWINS:,"Come play with us, Stewie, forever and ever and ever. Yes. All work and no play makes Stewie a dull boy."
S2e1,BUTLER:,"Across the hall from the library we have the billiard room. And here we have the lounge. Sweet Mary, mother of God! Jackpot! What can I get you, sir? We have 10 varieties of single malt scotch and a wine cellar with over 10,000 bottles. Don't make me beg. I did love spending time here when I was a kid. All right, Mom!"
S2e1,COCO:,"Jonathan and I just returned from sailing our yacht around the world. Funny sailing story. A guy's on his boat, in the middle of the ocean and he sees a little black dog. This dog's been swimming for days, and he stinks like a dead otter. Peter, maybe this isn't the place Hang on, Lois. So the guy takes the dog into the vet. The freakin' vet tells him, get this, ""It's not a dog. It's a rat."" A big, stinking Mexican rat. True story. Dad, that's just an urban legend. Hand to God. I'm telling you, it was a huge freakin' rat. Five times as big as that guy's steak."
S2e1,LOIS:,"Peter, that rat gets bigger every time you tell this story. I got a million of them. Like the time my buddy's sister's boss was drinking with a hooker in a Vegas bar. Bam! Woke up without his kidney. [Vomiting.]"
S2e1,PETER:,"I can't believe they kicked me out of the yacht club. I barely had time to stuff Lois' salmon in my jacket. Face it, Peter. You have a knack for saying the wrong thing. This sucks. Lois' friend ""yacht boy"" and his lovely wife ""Caca"" invited us to some hoity-toity auction tomorrow afternoon. I don't want to embarrass her again. You gotta help me. Teach me how to be a gentleman."
S2e1,BRIAN:,"Peter, it's not really that hard. Let's start with polite conversation. For example, ""It's a pleasure to see you again. Lovely weather we're having."" Now you try. It's a pleasure to see you again. After Hogan's Heroes, Bob Crane got his skull crushed in by a friend who videotaped him having rough sex. How's that?"
S2e1,BRIAN:,"Wow, perfect. My work is done. But just for the heck of it, let's try again."
S2e1,BUTLER:,"More coffee, madam?"
S2e1,LOIS:,"I can get that, Sebastian. To tell you the truth, we're all a little uncomfortable being waited on."
S2e1,STEWIE:,"Cut my egg! Your eggs are cut, sir. Cut my milk! I can't, sir. It's liquid. Imbecile! Freeze it, then cut it! If you question me again, I'll put you on diaper detail. And I promise, I won't make it easy for you! Meg, you're gonna love Newport High. It has a beautiful campus. Filled with beautiful people. And I'm gonna bag me a rich one. Meg, that's a terrible thing to say. You should marry someone you love. That's what I did. And he got us kicked out of the yacht club. You can't be mad at your father for being himself. That's the reason I fell in love with him in the first place. He was so different from everyone else. [Waltz music playing.]"
S2e1,JONATHAN:,"Coco, the day I graduate from Harvard l'm gonna carry you off into the sunset on a white horse. It better be a stretch horse with leather seats and a chauffeur. Isn't she a bit of terrific? [Laughing.] [Rock 'n' roll music playing.] Kids, if you marry for love, your life will be filled with its own riches. Money doesn't buy happiness."
S2e1,STEWIE:,I beg to differ. [Rings bells.]
S2e1,STEWIE:,"You! Bring me The Wall Street Journal! You two, fight to the death! [Dramatic instrumental music.] [Dramatic instrumental music.] Okay, Peter, I was hoping I wouldn't have to resort to shock therapy but your progress has been Who are we kidding? You haven't made any progress. Now the left TV is tuned to Frasier. The right TV has Ricki Lake. If you so much as glance at the right TV, I'm giving you 10,000 volts. Got it."
S2e1,NILES:,You're so corpulent that when you sit around the magnificently appointed Tuscan villa you sit around the magnificently appointed Tuscan villa. This is the smartest show on TV.
S2e1,GUEST:,"Yo, Ricki. That's my girlfriend. She ain't supposed to be having no penis! [Electricity surging.] Master Brian, do you really believe you can pass him off as a gentleman at the auction? We've got a long road ahead. But I've worked miracles before."
S2e1,PRESENTER:,"And the Oscar goes to Marisa Tomei! Peter was supposed to meet us here an hour ago. I hope he didn't change his mind. Maybe he's already here. Maybe he's fitting in so well, we can't tell him from the other bluebloods. I don't think we have to worry about that. [Trumpet fanfare.] Lord Peter Lowenbrau Griffin the First. Play me down the stairs, boys. [Band playing classical music.] Good day. Enchanté. Pasta Fazul. Looking good, fellas. Brian, do you know anything about this? Lois, please. I'm just a dog. A stupid dog. Vodka stinger with a whiskey back. And step on it! [Piano playing.]"
S2e1,COCO:,"Peter, you're simply enchanting. You must join us tomorrow for a game of baccarat. Right baccarat at you. [Laughing.] Brian, what happened to Peter? He's not cramming hors d'oeuvres in his mouth or asking anyone to pull his finger."
S2e1,LOIS:,"That's not the man I married. So, I guess, technically, that makes you available. What? Lighten up, toots. It's a party. [Laughing.] Barkeep, it's like the damn Sahara over here! How you doing, honey?"
S2e1,BRANDYWINE:,"Welcome to the Historical Society Auction. Our first item is a 17th-century gilded vessel. We'll start the bidding at $140,000. What a marvelous vessel. It would look smashing in Lois's crapper. I mean ""crapier"". You are so right. Any woman would love to have that vase adorn her crapier. Jonathan! $140,000. $150,000. Brian, that sounded like Peter. Come here, you! [Laughing.] $160,000. $170,000. - $180,000. - $190,000. $200,000. We have a new record for the Historical Society! The vessel goes to $100 million! To Mr. Peter Griffin for an astonishing $100 million!"
S2e1,BRIAN:,"[Singing.] ""Money, money, money"""
S2e1,COCO:,"Peter, we had no idea you were such a philanthropist. It's a fabulous vase, Peter, darling. Do you collect objets d'art? If that's French for ""Star Wars collectors glasses,"" then si. [Laughing.] Mr. Griffin, you're the most generous man since Ted Turner. I'd like to announce I'm giving a gift the whole world can appreciate. I've colorized the moon. Peter, you don't have $100 million! Of course I do, my dear. Now, would that be cash or check? Drop by Cherrywood this evening. I'll have the money wired to me from my Swiss bank account. Very good, sir. You don't have a Swiss bank account! Right. My lawyer's advised me to keep some of my assets a secret in case things don't work out."
S2e1,LOIS:,"I'm going home. Where's Brian? I told this blonde inside I got a 500SL. Can you help me out? I'm sorry. But I've made my decision. We're moving back to Quahog as soon as we can get packed. Quahog, that one-horse town? Shut up. No, you shut up. No, you shut up. You're the one talking. There's no one else here. Everybody just shut up! What's that? The wind! A pox on Quahog!"
S2e1,BRIAN:,"Easy! If I ever go back to Quahog, it'll be just so I can poke poor people with a stick! Bon Jovi, everyone. Now I remember why I left Newport! It changes people. You kids have lost your values. You've lost your mind! And I don't much care for Stewie's new friends. The Pacific Rim economy is still a tad shaky for my taste. Stop it! You can't become a bloody fiscal hermit crab every time the Nikkei undergoes a correction! Asia's market has nowhere to go but up! Interesting. Indeed. I wish we'd never come here in the first place. [Sighing snobbishly.] Go buy yourself some more money. Hey, old bean. What are you doing with my Star Wars glass? Illustrating a point. Peter, when Han Solo took the Millennium Falcon to Cloud City he saw that Lando Calrissian had turned control of the station over to Darth Vader. Lando had forgotten who he was. It was only after Han was encased in carbonite and taken by Boba Fett to Jabba's palace that he was able to see the error of his ways. Look inside yourself. You're not a Newport millionaire. I created you. In a way, I am your father. That's not true! That's impossible. Damn it, Peter! Snap out of it! No! I just had the craziest dream where I bought a $100 million vase."
S2e1,BUTLER:,A Mr. Brandywine from the Historical Society is at the front gate. He'll be here in half an hour.
S2e1,BRIAN:,"That wasn't a dream. He's here for the money. Brian, I'm screwed. If I welsh on that debt, I'm gonna prove to everyone that I'm not good enough for Lois. If I only had something worth that much money. I never should've dropped Joe Green's jersey. Good game, Mean Joe. You want some of my Coke? Hey, kid. Catch. Wow. Thanks, Mean Joe. What about this house? I could give him the house and call it even. Cherrywood isn't worth $100 million. Brian, it's the Historical Society. We just gotta convince him that $100 million worth of history happened here. So you're saying that Jesus carved his name into this mantle 51 years before he was born. Yeah. He's Jesus. He can do anything. And look over here."
S2e1,PETER:,That's where the market crashed.
S2e1,BRANDYWINE:,"Mr. Griffin! You can't take a step in this house without uncovering something historical. [Locomotive choo-chooing.] Wait a second. Could that be Harriet Tubman's secret underground railroad? It is! Go, Freedom Train! I've seen enough. I happen to know that nothing of historical significance ever occurred here. Please, have our money ready by tomorrow. Good day! Wait! Look, this is where the Pilgrims landed at Fraggle Rock!"
S2e1,LOIS:,"Excuse me, Lord Griffin. Your family is going back to Quahog. If you get tired of being a snob, look us up. Lord Griffin is dead. It's just me, Peter the towel boy. Peter, you're back! Let's go home! We can't. I sold our home. Our beautiful home with the stolen cable and the man with the penis for a light switch."
S2e1,LOIS:,"We'll find another place. Your Aunt Marguerite is laughing at me while she's burning in Hell may she rest in peace. She was right. Everyone was right. I'm not good enough for you. Peter, I don't care what anyone else thinks. All that matters is that I love you. I love you, too, Lois. [Gears grinding.] Lois, our problems are over!"
S2e1,PETER:,"Our mansion is historical, all right. Cherrywood was America's first presidential whorehouse! See, there's Lincoln, Grant, Robert E. Lee. Those are fake! They're real. And, FYI, Lincoln had the jungle fever. So you see, Chubby Franklin lived across the street. Chubby Franklin would always make a face like this. Dad, you're not listening. I have a serious problem. I got a girl pregnant. What do I do? And when we saw Chubby Franklin make his face, we would all make this face. [Audience laughing.] [Rubbery warbling.] Oh, God! Dad, you never did tell us how you got our house back. Simple. I just offered the people I sold it to double what they paid. What? But how could you afford that? I kept one of those Lincoln pictures and held a little auction of my own. Thanks to old Honest Abe we have our house back and I learned a valuable lesson. It doesn't matter if your family doesn't think I'm good enough for you. That's right, because all that's important is that I love you. No, because your ancestors were nothing but a bunch of pimps and whores. [Laughing.] [Theme music.]"
S2e2,LOIS:,"[Singing.] ""It seems today that all you see ""is violence in movies and sex on TV ""But where are those good, old-fashioned values ""on which we used to rely? ""Lucky there's a family guy ""Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you ""all the things that make us ""laugh 'n' cry ""He's a family guy"" Mrs. Lipstein, I have bad news. The tumor is malignant. I'm afraid you only have six months to live. Oh, my God!"
S2e2,ANNOUNCER:,"Got milk? Listen up, everybody. Your Grandpa Griffin is finally retiring. Grandpa Griffin? Is he the one that smells like firewood and has big gray pussywillows in his ears? Chris, that's a terrible word. ""Pussywillows."" My dad worked at that mill for 60 years. That's almost 80 years. Tomorrow we'll all go to a big dinner to honor him. Why? We barely know him. Yeah. How come he never visits us? Kids, your grandfather has never been comfortable with the fact that I'm not Catholic. [Church bells ringing.] Dad loves all of us. He's just too busy working to show it. He's been that way since I was a kid. And now the winners of the father-son three-legged race. First place, Bobby Hammill and his dad. Second place, Jimmy Lawson and his dad. Third place, Peter Griffin and a stalk of corn. Now that he's retiring, we can finally spend some time together. I want us to have one of those father-son moments, like on TV. Where we hug and the music goes [Band playing sentimental music.] Thanks, boys. Just like that. Can you do that fluttery thing like when the Brady kids run down the stairs? [Band playing fluttery music.] I don't want to tattle. But is Bobby really a doctor? [Trombone sputtering.] Mom, I can't eat. I'm too grossed out by Grandpa's ears. I know. They're like a big, gray enchanted forest. Kids, your grandfather's ears are not gross. And they are certainly not an enchanted forest. [High-pitched noise.] But seriously, tonight we here at Pawtucket Mill celebrate the career of our oldest and most dedicated employee, Francis Griffin. Francis. [Applause.] [Whistling.] At mass this morning it occurred to me that I may never see any of your faces again. I just want to say that Jesus loves you. But in my eyes, you're a bunch of sinners and slackers who forced a hard-working old man to retire. So you can take this shiny watch and shove it. [Gasping.] I adore this man! That was some speech, Dad. Yeah. It's a shame Grandma wasn't there to hear it. Bless her heart. She's on another one of her prayer missions in Las Vegas. Hit me, you five-card stud. [Hacking cough.] Cocktail! Aye, she's a rose. It's a pity you couldn't find yourself a nice Irish Catholic girl, Peter. Francis, this must be embarrassing for you. I'm in the car. Now that you're retired, you're coming to stay with us. No more excuses. I'm putting my foot down. [Brakes screeching.] Brian, buckle up. What do you say, Dad? - I don't want to be a bother. - It's no bother, is it, Lois? Of course not. It'll be fun. You're a good woman, Lois. Perhaps you won't burn in Hell after all. Maybe you'll just go to purgatory with all the unbaptized babies. There you go, Lois. You love kids. Look at that. Dad's reading Stewie to sleep, just like he never did for me. ""So God cast the pagans and sinners into the fiery bowels of Hell ""where their flesh burned in agony forever and ever."" The end. Children love a good bedtime story from the Bible. Yes, charming. Like when God told Abraham to kill Isaac. Hey! That was a lovely service, Francis. Super. And only three more hours till school. I didn't even know there was a 5:00 a.m. Mass. I didn't even know there was a 5:00 a.m. What else haven't you told me? I rather like this God fellow. He's very theatrical, you know. A pestilence here and a plague there. Omnipotence! Got to get me some of that. Yes. We all enjoy the Bible in this house. Really? What's your favorite book of the Bible? That one where Jesus swallows the puzzle piece and the man in the big yellow hat has to take him to the hospital. [Knocking.] Open this door! Open it, I say! [Toilet flushes.] Sorry, Grandpa. You might want to give that a minute or two. I know what you're doing in there, and it's a sin! If you ever do it again, you'll burn in Hell! But I do it every day. Sometimes twice. Mark my words, lad. You may think you're alone, but God's watching. Don't do it again! God's watching me do number two? I'm a sinner, and God's a pervert. Megan! How was school? Good. Kevin walked me home. - Kevin? - He lives next door. He lives next door to a harlot! Grandpa, we were just holding hands. It'll be easy for him to take your hand when God strikes your heart with leprosy. He can take it right home with him! Lord, it's great to see you kids. [Theme from The Dick Van Dyke Show.] [Cheerful theme music continues.] Francis, we were watching that. I'll tell you how it ends. Laura burns the roast and God kills her for parading her bum around in those pants! [Baseball field organ music playing.] Yeah, not a bad way to kick off your retirement, huh, Dad? Yeah, the magic of baseball has brought fathers and sons together for millions of years. Stewie's having fun. Why does that man drop his club before he runs around? I would bring it with me. Hey, who wants a Fenway frank? Nothing says, ""Please talk to me, Daddy,"" like a Fenway frank. Is there a bathroom here? I don't think I can wait anymore. In a public restroom, lad? For the good of your soul, show some restraint. Hey, hot dog guy! I'll get him. Oh, no, Dad, they bring them to you. Well, la-de-da. I don't need my food brought to me. I'm not a broken-down old mule! I can still work! I can still take orders! Oh, hey! Hey, look! Hey, Dad! Aw, crap. That was money well-spent. He just left without saying anything? Where would he go? I don't know. I asked him to buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks. I don't care if he ever gets back. I wasn't being cute. I really hope he's dead. Tom, the city of Boston is examining its conscience tonight in preparation for a visit from the Pope. That's right, Diane. I'll tell you what else will be examined, this cock. The Rhode Island Cock Society is sponsoring free check-ups for this year's Cock Awareness Week. I don't know why the suggestive name. They could've just as easily gone with ""rooster."" I'm telling you. Something must've happened to him. He's probably hurt, or lost, or shanghaied by pirates! That renegade pirate ship captained by the ruthless Peg Leg Swantoon! [Phone ringing.] Peter, calm down. It's his first night of retirement. He's probably out enjoying himself. He's in jail."
S2e2,PETER:,"Dad, my God, are you okay? Don't be using the Lord's name in vain! He's okay! Thank God!"
S2e2,COP:,"It seems he broke into the old mill after hours. We found him working on a kick press. Dad, you left the ball game with me to go work in a mill? Yes! I want to work! I want my job back! But, Dad, you're retired. I'd rather be dead. I'll tell you what's dead. Vaudeville. You know what killed it? Talkie pictures. But you can still make it. You just need a gimmick. I, for one, am a tumbler. Here, watch my round-off. Hey, be a sport. Take the pills out of my pocket and put one under my tongue. I don't get it, Lois. Baseball's always been the secret to male bonding. It even worked for Rosie O'Donnell and his father in A League of Their Own. I hate to say this but it doesn't seem like your dad is interested in bonding with you. All he cares about is work. Wait a second. Work! That's what'll bring us together. We can start our own father-son business. [Theme from Sanford & Son.] What are you doing with all them bathtubs, you heathen dummy? Pop, why you gotta be like that? We cut 'em in half, stick a Virgin Mary in them and sell them as shrines. That's my boy. At least, that's what your mama always told me. Now give me a hug before I give you a knuckle sandwich. Or you could just get your father a job with you at the toy factory. That's an even better idea! Lois, you're a genius. Now give me a hug before I give you a knuckle sandwich."
S2e2,LOIS:,"Peter, I can't hug you. Cut it out. I'm serious. And this is the nerve center of the whole factory, my station. I assemble our new action figure, Zeke, the moody drifter. You mean to tell me you stand here all day playing with dolls? It's not easy. See, I gotta twist on his head and stick a tiny pack of smokes in his torn denim jacket. [Coughing.] Any of you kids want to see a dead body? Wait here, Dad. Hey, Mr. Weed? Peter. Listen, I was wondering if you might have a job for my dad. Your father? He must be a man of at least 70. Oh, yeah. But he's in great shape. Except his prostate. At 2:00 a.m. Last night, I thought a horse was using the bathroom. All finished. What's next? You did my whole day's work in five minutes. We should sell you to the circus, you freak! I've never seen such productivity. How is this possible? I'll tell you how it's possible. Because this man always put his job before everything else. His wife, his health, even his own son. Especially his own son. I need hear no more. Everyone, this is your new shop foreman. Welcome aboard, sir. Lead as you see fit. Dad, after all these years, you and me together, side by side, father and son. Peter, this is truly a miracle. I'm so grateful. Hold that thought. Hey, boys, you're on. [Sentimental music playing.] Go ahead, Dad. Thank you, Jesus. I have a purpose in life again. Hey! Break up the sewing circle and get back to work! My, my. What a thumping good read! Lions eating Christians, people nailing each other to two-by-fours. I say, you won't find that in Winnie the Pooh. Please don't say ""pooh."" Are you all right? Where's your father? Still at the factory. He's turning the break room into a chapel. A chapel? Where will you all eat lunch? Lois, lunch is a sin. Taking a break is a sin. Bestiality is a sin. I'm not sure how that came up exactly, but me and Dad have never been closer. Having him at the factory is the best [Snoring.]"
S2e2,MAN:,"I got it. Your dad stinks. I'm working triple shifts, and I'm still not Employee of the Week. How am I supposed to compete with that?"
S2e2,PETER:,"Where is he anyway? This'll be for my fourth birdie. Looks like someone's in the zone. Tough break there, Jesus. Yup. Or was it? Boo-yah! Back to work, all of you! What's going on here? Dad, some of the guys think that since you took over, work is no fun. - Work's not supposed to be fun. - Why not? Why not? That's Satan talking! You're a failure as a worker and as a father! Now wait a minute. I may not be perfect. At least I love my kids enough not to spend every minute of the day working! I'm a damn good father, and that's more than I can say about you! [Gasping.] Peter, you've never spoken to me like that before. You're fired! Well, in that case, I'm suing you for sexual harassment. I'll see you at home."
S2e2,GRANDPA:,"What are you doing, lad?"
S2e2,CHRIS:,Nothing!
S2e2,GRANDPA:,Something's wrong with your shower. The water's not cold enough. I like me showers colder than a well digger's kerblocken. I think it's time someone sits his kerfluffin' down and has a talk with his unemployed son. If he needs to talk he'd best go to confession to beg forgiveness for all his failings! Have a glorious day.
S2e2,LOIS:,"How can you just sit there and let him talk like that? He's right, Lois. I am no good. Even my own dad doesn't love me. Face it. I'm going to Hell."
S2e2,PETER:,"Adolf Hitler, Al Capone, John Wilkes Booth. Hey, what are you doing here? I killed a hooker. She made a crack about me being faster than a speeding bullet so I ripped her in half like a phone book."
S2e2,STEWIE:,"Yes, the fat man's going to Hell. And from the looks of his midsection, he'll burn like a tire dump for all eternity. Oh! I love God! He's so deliciously evil. Stewie, eat your oatmeal. Honey, you're a wonderful husband a loving father, and, for some reason I'll never understand a very devoted son. That's a nice thought, Lois, but sadly, it means nothing coming from you."
S2e2,TOM:,The moment has arrived at last. We now go live to Logan International Airport where the Pope's plane has just touched down.
S2e2,EMCEE:,"Hello, Boston! Are you ready to humble yourself before God? [Crowd cheering.] What? Have you all taken a vow of silence? Come on! [Crowd cheering.] Then put your hands together for the one, the only His Holiness, the Pope! [Band playing upbeat music.] Hey, I just got a crazy idea! Why? Why? Hey, I just got another crazy idea! Hey, did you ever notice this? On page 375, it says ""Jebus."" It's supposed to be ""Jesus,"" right? - Room service! - We didn't order no room service. Actually I just wanted to check the honor bar. The last Pope we had here filled his shaving kit with Necco wafers. All right, wise guy, who are you? I'm just a faithful Catholic man with a family crisis only His Holiness can resolve. I've never asked the church for anything, but I don't know where else to turn. Dust him! My heavens, son! Are you okay? Yeah. I just got bounced by the Pope's road crew. It's good you missed me. I'm to drive the Popemobile. Any slight bump on the head knocks me unconscious for a few hours. I always wake up fine, but it's just so darn inconvenient to be knocked out that easily. Even by the slightest tap. Like this. [Crowd cheering.] Taking it off here, Boss. - Take it off there, Luke. - Wiping it off, Boss. - Wipe it off, Nine. - Waving at the Pope here, Boss. Wave at the Pope there, Luke. Are you sure this is Boston? Yeah, it's Boston. See, look, there's Harvard. That's just a barn. Someone went to Yale."
S2e2,PETER:,"Lois, put the coffee on."
S2e2,LOIS:,"Careful. I just cleaned the floor. Good thing. Lemony. Your Holiness, this is such an honor. Please, go into the living room and make yourself at home! What is the Pope doing here? Relax. I just hijacked his bubble car so he can convince my dad I'm a good guy. You kidnapped the Pope? This is the most reckless thing you've ever done! Come on. What about the time I was on that airplane? [Giggling.] [Laughing.]"
S2e2,POPE:,"Peter, you've raised a fine family. Well, my dad thinks I'm a screw-up. I was hoping you could change his mind. He'd have to believe you. You're God's go-to guy. Your father is entitled to his opinion. But more important is what you think. Look deep in your heart, my son. Do you think you're a screw-up? [Sentimental instrumental music.] No. I'm not. You know what? I'm a damn good father."
S2e2,PETER:,I have great kids.
S2e2,MEG:,"That's not what Grandpa says. Grandpa is wrong. Meg, it's not a sin for a girl your age to like boys. Thanks, Daddy. And Chris, what you do in the bathroom is between you and God. And if you're sorry, he'll forgive you. Thanks, Dad! Good for you, Peter. But isn't there someone else you should speak to? Yes, there is. Scarecrow, you've had brains all along. Same goes for your heart, Tin Man. And Kristy McNichol, come back to television. We miss you. I meant you should talk to your father."
S2e2,PETER:,"You're right. You with me, big guy? Peter, I go where I am needed. To the Popemobile! [Theme from Batman.] [Desperate muttering.] Remember when we brought in that stripper for Lombardi's birthday and it turned out to be his son? I think this is gonna top it."
S2e2,MAN:,"Wow, it's the Pope!"
S2e2,GRANDPA:,"Slothful sinners! You're here to work, not sit around with your Holy Mother! It's the Holy Father. I am not worthy. Rise, my son. You are indeed worthy, for you have raised a fine son. His zest for life is an affirmation of God's great love within us all. Wow! And that's from the freakin' Pope! So I guess you were wrong about me, Dad. I was wrong all right. Stand by, boys. I was wrong about you! You've gone soft on me, Holy Father! Even a tambourine-shaking Baptist could tell this boy's no good! Are you calling me a liar? - Whoah, easy, Pontiff. - Because I'll excommunicate your sorry Okay, time out. Oh! I have never met such an infuriating man! You must have the patience of a saint. Well, he's my dad. And I just want him to love me. Peter, how could you say such a thing? I love you with all me heart. [Sentimental music playing.] - You do? - Of course. I just don't like you. I don't like anything about you! [Music stops.] Keep playing. I think this is as good as it gets. Dad, to be honest, I don't like you either. Jeez, that's a terrible thing to say. I guess I am going to Hell. The good Lord said to honor thy father. He never said anything about liking him. Well, in that case, Dad l'm gonna eat meat on Fridays, golf on Sundays laugh at Jewish comedians, and yes, sleep with my Protestant wife. But I won't enjoy it. And she hates it. Well, fine. I'll be on me way. Take back your job, and give your old man a hug. I love you, Dad. I know you do, Son. - What are you gonna do now? - I don't know. I guess the good Lord doesn't have much use for an old man like me. I suppose I could use another pair of hands on my tour. You'd give Dad a job, even knowing what a jerk he is? I have to. As you said, Peter, ""I am the freakin' Pope."" [Crowd cheering on TV.]"
S2e2,GRANDPA:,"All right, get back! No flash photography, or you'll go straight to Hell! You! You're in God's house, you heathen! Take that cap off before I take it off for you! I think your father found the perfect job. Let's hope so. I love being a good father. But I don't want to have to be a good son again for a long, long time. [Knocking.]"
S2e2,GRANDMA:,"Peter, open the door, and break out the schnapps! Guess who needs a place to sleep it off for the weekend? - Mom? - Oh, my God, no! Quick, everyone! Into the pod! [Exciting instrumental music.] [Theme music.]"
S2e5,BRIAN:,Swing and a miss.
S2e5,LOIS:,"[Singing.] ""It seems today that all you see ""is violence in movies and sex on TV ""But where are those good, old-fashioned values ""on which we used to rely? ""Lucky there's a family guy ""Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you ""all the things that make us ""laugh 'n' cry ""He's a family guy"" I have no friends, and it's all because of this stupid purse! What did you do to my daughter? I swear to God, if you touched her Honey, what happened? It was lunchtime and I love the color of your Prada bag. - Yeah, but yours has that great clasp. - Hey, Meg, you want to come to lunch? You know what? There's no room in my car for your big, ugly purse. [Girls laughing.] Meg, let me tell you about popularity. GIRL #1: Mrs. Canner? Are you coming?"
S2e5,CANNER:,"Bye! Daddy, if you really loved me, you'd buy me a Prada bag. I can't say no to you, honey. What are they, like, $10? More like $1,100. [Laughing.] You wish I loved you that much! [Sighs.] We'll never finish the float in time for the parade. Pick up the pace, guys! Peter, your theme is a dud. Yeah. I've never even seen Who's the Boss? Tuesdays in the '80s I was always in bed by 8:00 and home by 11:00. But I can't do it without you guys, because I'll tell you who's the boss. It's not Tony or Angela. It's not even man-crazy Mona. It's all of us. You're the boss because you never give up, like with the ladies. Gemini. Capricorn. I know you're not a Virgo! From down here, you look like a Pisces! And Cleveland, you're the boss because of your attention to detail. Like when we play pool, you take so long to line up your shots I just want to crack you with a cue stick. But I don't because that would be a hate crime, and I love you. And Joe, I've had new neighbors before, but none were half the man you are. Since you're half a man already, that splits them into some kind of fraction I can't even measure. He's right. If we work together, we can win this thing. Who's in? Go, Spooner Street! [Heroic instrumental music.] My dad always says, ""Measure twice, cut once."" My daddy always said, ""Cleveland Jr., quit jumping on the bed!"" [Laughing.] We didn't measure!"
S2e5,BRIAN:,"Amazing. The whole neighborhood is working together. You know what's really amazing? I haven't brushed my teeth in three days, and no one has said a thing. If I had a job, I could buy the bag myself. I have squandered my munitions budget on that insipid Rugrats video! Perhaps I should seek employment. Mother teaches piano. I suppose I could as well. All right, try it again, Richard. And remember, the wrong keys are electrified. [Electric shock.] I don't want to play the piano! Indeed. Would you rather play the bassoon? [Playing bassoon.] [Screams.] No experience? No, thanks. [Sighs.] [Whispering.] Oh, nuts. Young lady. What's the little guy's name? What do you care? I can't send an unwed teenage mother out on the street without a job. Stewie. My son's name is Stewie."
S2e5,DIANE:,"Welcome to the 83rd annual Quahog Harvest Festival Parade. Are you as excited as I am, Tom? Are you kidding, Diane? I've got wood and clipped onto it is a list of this year's float entries. Remember, the float that best captures this year's theme wins Quahog's coveted Golden Clam. And here's our first float."
S2e5,DIANE:,"It looks like some wires got crossed on Clover Street. That's not Angela. That's Mona, Angela's mom."
S2e5,TOM:,"Wonderful use of tree bark for the age spots though. This one's got Tony bathing Jonathan. That's just plain wrong. Each float possesses its own unique charm. But none of them Oh, baby! Look at that! The float turned out great. Our neighborhood hasn't been this united since Quagmire got us free cable."
S2e5,CLEVELAND:,We are not bad people. We just don't want to pay $12 a month for Cinemax. First place goes to Spooner Street. [Cheering.]
S2e5,RESIDENTS:,"We won! All right! [Uncomfortable laughter.] Come on now! This is damn foolish! My theme, my trophy! My aunt Fanny! You said it yourself! I'm the boss! He said I, too, was the boss. And it's time Cleveland got his due."
S2e5,BONNIE:,"Joe, my feet are starting to swell. You two go home. I can stay here as long as it takes. You'd be amazed how little one eats when your legs don't work. There's only one way to settle this. Russian Roulette. Three bullets, last guy standing keeps the trophy. Me first. No. Wait a minute, this is crazy. You first. There's gotta be a way for you all to enjoy the trophy. Wait a minute! I got it! No, lost it. There it is again!"
S2e5,LOIS:,"Perfect, Peter. Now we can all enjoy it. [Muttering approval.] Here's to togetherness! Car! [Car approaching.] Meg, order up! Here you go, hon. From Flappy himself. I don't care if they're from Kubla filthy-wretched Khan! Try them. You'll like them. Yes, well, I rather doubt that. Yes! These are delectable. Flappy, good news! I've decided not to kill you! What a precious little boy. That's my son. Your son? But you're just a baby yourself. Henry, give the little skank a nice tip. $20! Welcome to Flappy's. Why don't you sit next to my baby whose deadbeat dad doesn't pay child support. [Belching.] [Horrified scream.] [Dramatic instrumental music.] Peter, what is it?"
S2e5,CLEVELAND:,"What's going on out here? Clear the way! I'm a cop! Oh, my God! I thought the safety was on. I'm so sorry. That's okay, son. It's your right as an American citizen. [Screaming.]"
S2e5,QUAGMIRE:,"What's all the noise? I was just jerked out of a sound sleep. Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to the whereabouts of our Golden Clam? - Maybe it fell. - Yeah. Right into someone's pocket. You think one of us stole it? I never said the word ""stole."" Looks like someone has a guilty conscience. Guilty conscience! I'm the only guy on this block who actually pays for his cable. Pretty high and mighty for a man who left our nation's flag out in the rain last Fourth of July. That's against the law, Officer! [Gasping.] You're one to talk. Out there every trash day picking through my garbage. That's an invasion of my privacy. [Gasping.] He's sorting your recycling because he loves our Mother Earth. If you weren't so busy trolling for booty all the time you could do it yourself, like the law says you should. [Gasping.]"
S2e5,PETER:,It's on now!
S2e5,JOE:,"Wait a second! What about Peter? He's the one who wanted the trophy all along! I couldn't have stolen it. Last night I was stealing Joe's ladder so I could steal the trophy tonight. What? It's a ladder. He can't use it. It's like taking a watch off a dead guy. Those Griffins always were oddballs, Joe. Real oddballs. I don't trust them."
S2e5,LOIS:,I saw them taking coupons out of our mailbox.
S2e5,QUAGMIRE:,I don't like the look of her! I offer you a recipe. Combine one small-town neighborhood with a dash of missing trophy and what you're left with is a gumbo fit only for a madman. A gumbo served almost exclusively in The
S2e5,PETER:,Who the hell is that? I bet he took it!
S2e5,JOE:,"Where are you going, Serling? Want some of this?"
S2e5,QUAGMIRE:,Come back here! I'm off to work.
S2e5,PETER:,"Okay, honey. One of our neighbors took that trophy, and I'll find out who. - I'm taking Stewie with me again. - Fine, sweetie. This whole thing just makes me sick! - We played Pictionary with them! - Bastards! Giddy-up, you stubby little mare! To the pancake house! Well, bye. And to think they used to be our best friends! That was then and this is now! And this is a chair. That's a lamp. You have boobies. I'll find that trophy!"
S2e5,JOE:,"To be honest, Peter, we were all a little surprised you invited us over. We realized our friendship is a lot more important than some stupid trophy. [Kettle whistling.] There's the tea. I'll get it, Lois. Two sugars, right, Bonnie? [Suspenseful instrumental music.] Damn, it's not here! [Suspenseful instrumental music.] Not here either. [Footsteps.] [Suspenseful instrumental music.] ['60s lounge music on stereo.] Nothing. Oh, my God! We were robbed! - Is anything missing? - No. I don't think so."
S2e5,LOIS:,"Where's that picture of me in my two-piece? Should I call the cops? I'm guessing a cop had something to do with this. Or a pilot. Or a deli owner. Okay, you dirtbags! This means war! Excuse us. We're having a small problem with home security. Do you have those round metal things that you bury in the ground and, when stepped on, they explode? - Land mines? - Land mines. It was land mines. - Quagmire. - Peter. - Cleveland. - Joe. - Bonnie. - Lois. - Cleveland. - Lois. Bonnie. - Quagmire. - Peter. [Clears throat.] Loretta. Come on, Peter. That ought to slow them down. Being a single mother is hard. The real challenge is having a baby that's addicted to crack. - Right, Stewie? - What's that? Yes. I love crack. I'm absolutely coo-coo for crack! This is the first time he's eaten something other than dog food in three weeks. Here's your check. God bless."
S2e5,WAITRESS:,"Here, Honey."
S2e5,STEWIE:,"What's this? Blueberries? Oh, my That's better than sex! And could I get that waitress' address? I'd like to help her baby. What are they up to? Cleveland and Quagmire are holding their positions but I haven't seen Joe all day."
S2e5,JOE:,Freeze!
S2e5,KEVIN:,Dad?
S2e5,JOE:,Careful. There's a bear trap two feet to your right.
S2e5,KEVIN:,"Thanks, Dad."
S2e5,JOE:,Look out for your mother!
S2e5,BONNIE:,"There's a sandwich on the counter, honey. Cleveland, these lobster traps aren't going to catch any intruders. Yes, they will. I baited them with these plump and tasty Fenway franks. Daddy, we got one! Fat boy smelled a hot dog. Couldn't help it. Went right in. [Laughing.] [Classical instrumental music.] - Hello. - Say, get the hell off Hello, lips, legs, breasts, and ass. Yes. I was hoping I could ask you about your neighbors, the Griffins. A bunch of card-carrying Commies if you ask me! All right. No! It's not all right! CLEVELAND"
S2e5,JR:,"Fat boy! The Griffins are not to be trusted. Those people are nothing but vile, cheating, lying scum. And their carpet and drape scheme No! No, I won't! Get that puree of loathsomeness away from me! But you love mashed turkey and peas. I'm sorry. What was that? Sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Did you just tell me what I love? Write this down, you toad-faced frump. I love pancakes! Hi, little fella."
S2e5,SANDY:,Is Meg Griffin here?
S2e5,LOIS:,"No, she's not. Probably out scoring more rock. Sandy Balfour, Child Services. We're placing this baby in a foster home. - What? - For God's sake, feed me! Let me guess. All out of Puppy Chow? What an awful home for a child! How dare you! This is a wonderful home! [Gunshot.]"
S2e5,PETER:,"Quagmire, you rat bastard! Come near my fence again, and that'll be your head!"
S2e5,QUAGMIRE:,"Shut up! Honey, would you like some pancakes? Oh, yes! God, yes! Take me! Stewie!"
S2e5,MEG:,"Next up is Meg Griffin, sporting her stylishly cool, brand-new A woman from Child Services came and took Stewie! She said we fed him dog food! Dog food? Is that a real Prada bag? How in the world did you make $1,100 as a waitress in one week? It's easy when you're the unwed teenage mother of a crack-addicted baby. [Laughing nervously.] Wait a minute. Meg, when did you become a teenager? She's 16, Peter. You knew about this? FOSTER"
S2e5,MOM:,"Welcome to your new home. Baby Stewie, say hello to your new brothers and sisters. Hola, Stewie. Ni hao, Stewie. Stewie. Good God! I've been adopted by a Benetton ad! - I promise, it'll never happen again. - I hope not, Mrs. Stevens. Because next time we won't just take him away, we'll kill him. Let's see. Stanley, Starkweather, Stevens! So this is where babies come from? Yes, Chris. This is where babies come from. You told me I came out of your vagina! Next! Hi. Yeah, we're the Griffins. - I'm sorry. I can't find your paperwork. - Look harder! I want my baby back! Please, let me handle this. The name's Griffin. We're the ones who fed dog food to our crack-addicted baby. I never was any good at dealing with the authorities. [Police siren.] Don't worry. I know how to handle this. Are you aware you were going 50 in I'm gonna have to ask you to put your shirt down. Crap. I get the one straight cop in Rhode Island. [Stewie screams angrily.]"
S2e5,STEWIE:,"Damn it! I want pancakes! You people understand every language except English! Yo quiero pancakes! Donnez-moi pancakes! Click-click-bloody-click pancakes! Poor little guy. ""Pancakes"" must be street for ""crack."" Damn those parents of his. Sarah, forgiveness. Now, Stewie, why don't you go play with the others?"
S2e5,GIRL:,"Stewie, come complete our rainbow! I've got a better idea. Let's go play ""swallow the stuff under the sink."" You lied to them! You told Child Services that we steal lawn mowers and cheat on our taxes and worship some guy named Stan. Actually, I said Satan. That's a typo. We didn't know who she was! It's not our fault! No? Then whose fault is it?"
S2e5,BRIAN:,"It's all of yours! You were all working together just fine, but then you won that stupid trophy. You put some shiny hunk of metal before your own friendships. Brian's right. We were so obsessed with that trophy, we lost sight of what was really going on. - Now we have a real problem to deal with. - That's right! Somebody tipped off the cable company about our free Cinemax. Joe? And we have to get Stewie back!"
S2e5,PETER:,I remembered.
S2e5,CLEVELAND:,We're here to help. And we must get our baby back. Right on! Let's do it! Rock their world!
S2e5,GROUP:,"Yeah! Come on! Let's go! We can do it! See kids? One day the world is going to be just like our home. All races living together in harmony and love. [Creaking.] Pancakes! He must still be working the junk out of his system. He needs hugs! [Doorbell ringing.] Doorbell! We're from the One World, One People Book-of-the-Month Club. Is there something missing in your life? You know, I just bet there is. Sarah, we have guests! And one of them is a homosexual!"
S2e5,BONNIE:,"They're in place! God, it gets me hot when Joe lies to strangers. When I get him home, I swear I'm gonna grease up That's fine, Debbie. Go, Chris. Here we go, Dad! Stewie, would you like to learn how to wrap a turban? Why don't you teach it to the Chinese girl? Or perhaps she can learn after her people invade your country. Yee, would your people really do this? Try and stop them. And try and stop Pablo's people from using drug money to buy arms from Li's countrymen, who in turn sells them to Ura's people so they can ethnically cleanse this nauseatingly diverse grab bag of genetic party favors you call a family. So now you all understand, yes? You all hate each other? [Crying.] Hosanna! It's the lesser of two evils. Hey, kids. I'm Santa Claus. Just practicing for Christmas. But you're white. Jack and Sarah told me Santa is Indian. Don't be stupid! Santa is black! Santa can't be black. We do not fear him. CHINESE"
S2e5,GIRL:,"Cram it, Gandhi! Santa is Asian. How can he be Asian? Santa doesn't drive his sled 20 miles under the speed limit with his blinker on! Go back to your rice paddy, Mulan! [Yelling.]"
S2e5,PETER:,"Come on, Stewie. We're out of here. Dance, puppets! Dance! Lois, we got him. It's all over."
S2e5,LOIS:,"Careful, Peter. Joe and Cleveland can't stall them. They're heading your way! Crap! FOSTER"
S2e5,DAD:,Hold it right there! Or what? Don't shoot!
S2e5,STEWIE:,"Now shoot! So, we're terribly sorry we broke into your home. But we just had to get Stewie back somehow. That's a very long story. But we've grown attached to little Stewie. Plus, the law's on our side. You people can kiss the fattest part of my ass! We'll be back, Stewie. FOSTER"
S2e5,MOM:,"Wait! Is that a real Prada bag? I'd like to propose a toast to our neighbors. Sure they may be black, handicapped, and a heartless sex hound but if they moved out, some smelly Hawaiians might move in. - Hear, hear! - Where's Quagmire? If it wasn't for him, we never would have found out where Stewie's foster family lived. He said he'd distract the social worker. Glen, honey, I have a question for you. What do you do for a living? I have a question for you, too. Why are you still here? What the heck happened to that trophy anyway? I guess some mysteries are better left unsolved. [Chattering.] Submitted for your approval. A family pet with the uncontrollable urge to bury shiny objects in the yard. A shameful secret that nearly buried the peace and civility of an entire neighbor Stewie seems a little feverish after his ordeal. And he keeps asking for pancakes. Let's just let him rest. Flappy, what have you done to me? It's so hot. Now I'm freezing! What I wouldn't do for one syrup-soaked bite. [Screams.]"
S2e6,LOIS:,"[Singing.] ""It seems today that all you see ""is violence in movies and sex on TV ""But where are those good, old-fashioned values ""on which we used to rely? ""Lucky there's a family guy ""Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you ""all the things that make us ""laugh 'n' cry ""He's a family guy"" [Crickets chirping.] - I'm Morley Safer. - I'm Mike Wallace. - I'm Ed Bradley. - I'm Lesley Stahl. And one of you is hung like an elf. [Laughing.]"
S2e6,LOIS:,I feel so naughty.
S2e6,PETER:,"Lois, what are you doing? Neither of us is drunk. [Giggling.]"
S2e6,PETER:,Knock it off!
S2e6,LOIS:,"Oh, my God! I found a lump! A breast lump! The important thing is to stay calm. It's probably nothing, honey. That's easy for you to say. You get to keep both your cans. Peter, don't talk like that! You'll see a doctor tomorrow and No. I'm not gonna see a doctor, Lois. The healthiest thing we can do is just ignore this and pretend it doesn't exist. Just like we do with the squid."
S2e6,LOIS:,Earthquake.
S2e6,PETER:,Truck going by.
S2e6,PETER:,I'm gonna be fine. Nothing to worry about. [Cat hisses.] [Vulture screeches.]
S2e6,MAN:,"Morning. Give it to me straight, Doc. How long do I have? Mr. Griffin, I'd say you have about a month to live. But what the hell do I know? I've been sued by every patient I ever had. Look at the size of this file. This is Wow. Let's just wait for the test results. Finish up, honey. Then I'll put you down for a nice nap. No! I shall put you down for a nap, Mother! Blast! I'm so worried about your father. You mean because he's a borderline alcoholic? No. Mommy's made peace with that. Because he's got a lump on his booby. Chris, that's a terrible word, ""booby."" Mom, Debbie Miller's dad had a lump on his breast, and he turned out okay. Really? Who's Debbie Miller? A girl I just made up. Look. Here they are. My family. Guys, I don't say this often enough, but I'm gonna die."
S2e6,LOIS:,"Oh, my God."
S2e6,STEWIE:,"High five! Anyone? Anyone? You can't die! Who's gonna take me to the Father-Son dance? Listen, I've had a good life. You can always be proud of your father and all of his accomplishments."
S2e6,MEG:,Accomplishments?
S2e6,PETER:,"Go to your room. Peter, there's no way you could die. You're the most important character in this family. [Somber music playing.] I'll take this one. But I won't pay a cent over $60. Sir, that casket costs $1,000."
S2e6,PETER:,"Okay, $70."
S2e6,SALESMAN:,What?
S2e6,PETER:,"$2,000."
S2e6,SALESMAN:,That's twice the cost!
S2e6,PETER:,$40.
S2e6,SALESMAN:,"What? He doesn't know how to haggle. Peter, what's going on? I'm selling all my worldly goods, so you'll have some cash when I'm dead. Yeah, a lot of memories here. Look, my first bike. Boy, I had so much fun playing with that. More tea, Mr. Bike? Peter, this is ridiculous. You're going to be fine. Dad, the doctor called. Your test results are in. This doesn't look very good. No, this doesn't look very good at all. My nephew drew my portrait. It doesn't look a thing like me. Look at the nose. It's all Will you just tell us about Peter's tests? Okay. Mr. Griffin, all your tests came back negative. As it turns out, the lump on your chest was just a fatty corpuscle. Fatty corpuscle? Wait a minute. How the hell can a dead comedian from the silent movie era be lodged in my left bosom? Mr. Griffin, I'm saying you're fine. I'm fine? What? Are you coming on to me now? Peter, he's not coming on to you. He's trying to tell you that you're healthy. Can't it be both? [Kissing.] My sweetie is okay. Better than okay, Lois. From now on, I'm gonna appreciate all the little things in life, like you and the kids. Is this the price of my bill or my phone number? Your phone number. [Sheepish laughter.]"
S2e6,PETER:,It's still pretty pricey!
S2e6,LOIS:,"Peter, who cares how much it is? You've just got the most important bill of all, a clean bill of health. Jeez, Lois. How long you been waiting to crack out that gem?"
S2e6,PETER:,"This sucks, Brian. Why should I have to pay this? - There's nothing wrong with me. - Too bad you're not dying. Wait a second. That's it! They can't make a dead guy pay his bill. All I gotta do is write ""deceased"" right here where it says ""name."" And where it says ""sex,"" I'll write, ""No, thanks. I'm dead."" It's bulletproof. [Crickets chirping.] But you promised the fat one would perish. I know. Isn't it wonderful, honey? Your father is alive and well and we can be a family for a good long [Knocking.] Who are you?"
S2e6,DEATH:,I'm Calista Flockhart. Who the hell do you think I am? I'm Death.
S2e6,DEATH:,Which one of you is Peter Griffin?
S2e6,PETER:,He is.
S2e6,DEATH:,"Come on, man. Which one of you is Peter Griffin? This is Peter Griffin. [Laughing.]"
S2e6,DEATH:,That's a good one. [Continues laughing.]
S2e6,LOIS:,Why are you
S2e6,DEATH:,"No, wait. I'm not finished holding my sides. [Continues laughing.] Why are [Continues laughing.] Why [Continues laughing.] Why are you here? The doctor said Peter was okay."
S2e6,DEATH:,"The doctor! I guess he must know, right? I mean, he's a doctor and everything, and I'm just Death!"
S2e6,STEWIE:,Excuse me. Hello! I'm Stewie. Big fan.
S2e6,PETER:,"Death, you made a mistake. I'm not supposed to be dead."
S2e6,DEATH:,I made a mistake? What's this?
S2e6,LOIS:,"Peter, is that your handwriting? [Nervous laughter.] How did you get that?"
S2e6,DEATH:,"Your HMO emailed it to me. I know my doctor was hitting on me, but you don't have to call him names. I don't care what that says! You can't take my husband! Mother! Where are your manners? Don't argue with our guest!"
S2e6,STEWIE:,Won't you join us for dinner?
S2e6,DEATH:,"Oh, no. I don't want to impose."
S2e6,DEATH:,Is that turkey?
S2e6,LOIS:,"Yes, Death. We were in the middle of a turkey dinner to celebrate Peter's good health."
S2e6,DEATH:,Do you mind?
S2e6,STEWIE:,"Mind? Of course not. It would be an honor. No, it would be a privilege. Oh, dear. Listen to me prattling on like a schoolgirl. Come, come. You, heat up some gravy for our guest! My last helping of white meat was drier than Oscar Wilde. How did you do that?"
S2e6,DEATH:,"Let's just say, when I was younger I did some films I'm not particularly proud of."
S2e6,DEATH:,"That does it for me. Wait! You can't go. After dinner, we usually go into the living room and live for another 40 or 50 years."
S2e6,DEATH:,"[Laughing.] 40 or Let's go. I guess this is good-bye. Meg, you're the man of the family now. Be strong. Daddy. Stewie, I guess I'm not gonna be here to see you become a man. Yes. I think we all know what that's going to be like. A 20-minute call to Larchmont? Who do we know in Larchmont? STEWIE'S"
S2e6,WIFE:,"My sister-in-law. Yes, right. Right. Carol. Yes. That's right. How is Carol? - Brian. - Oh, God. - Daddy, can I come with you? - Ask your mother. No, you can't go with him! - Oh, Peter. - Lois. [Crying.]"
S2e6,DEATH:,"Okay, that's good. Come on now."
S2e6,PETER:,"Hey, Death, you got a file on me?"
S2e6,DEATH:,"Yeah, it's in the car, I think. Does it mention that I ran two weeks of Junior Varsity track?"
S2e6,DEATH:,Let's not do this. I caught Flo Jo. You don't think I can catch you? [Screaming.]
S2e6,DEATH:,My ankle!
S2e6,DEATH:,"Yeah, listen, don't help or anything. I'm totally fine. Damn Irish."
S2e6,DEATH:,"Yeah. That felt good, dropping me on the couch like that."
S2e6,LOIS:,Here's some Tylenol.
S2e6,DEATH:,"Great. Tylenol. I asked for Advil. But, you know, whatever. That's good. I got a B-plus in Health. Is there anything I can do?"
S2e6,DEATH:,"Why don't you boil some water and rip up some sheets there, Einstein. It's a sprained ankle."
S2e6,DEATH:,I have to stay off it for a while.
S2e6,PETER:,Not here.
S2e6,DEATH:,Why?
S2e6,PETER:,"You tried to kill me! Besides, how are we supposed to explain you to Mr. Roper?"
S2e6,LOIS:,"It's okay, Death. You just worry about feeling better. What the hell are you doing? Peter, don't you see? As long as he's here, you can't die."
S2e6,PETER:,Go on.
S2e6,LOIS:,That's it.
S2e6,PETER:,"Wait a minute. So no matter what I do, I won't die? Make yourself at home, Death."
S2e6,PETER:,I'm going out for a while.
S2e6,DEATH:,"Wait. You can't tell anyone I'm here. For if humanity discovers l'm no longer lurking in the shadows, consequences will be dire."
S2e6,PETER:,Go on.
S2e6,DEATH:,That's it. What the hell do you see in him? What the hell do you see in him?
S2e6,LOIS:,"Peter, where are you going? Lois, 10 minutes ago, I was staring Death in the face. Now that I've been given another chance l'm gonna do the one thing I've always dreamed of doing. I'm gonna jump off this building. Could you repeat that, please, Peter? I believe I had something crazy in my ear. Hold the phone. You took me away from a Swedish girlie-girl and her paralyzed, but trusting, cousin for this? - $1,000 says I live. - $1,000, huh? - What the hell? - Okay. Look at that. I beat my loogie. [Grumbling.]"
S2e6,LOIS:,"It's your turn, Death."
S2e6,DEATH:,"I know I should find this ironic, but I'm just bored as hell. How old is this TV? You can probably get the DuMont Network on this thing."
S2e6,LOIS:,Peter is a good man and a wonderful father.
S2e6,DEATH:,"Here it comes. Could you please find it in your heart to spare him? After all, it isn't really his time."
S2e6,DEATH:,"What did you use for this cocoa, crap?"
S2e6,LOIS:,If you want me to make it again
S2e6,DEATH:,"Sorry, my fault. I just assumed you were gonna make it with milk, not crap!"
S2e6,LOIS:,I'll be right back.
S2e6,MEG:,I brought you a magazine.
S2e6,DEATH:,"Glamour, great. I can learn how to please my man. Go get me an Entertainment Weekly. I hear it's got a great picture of me sneaking up on Tom Snyder. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] [Screaming.] [Saw buzzing.] Victory is mine! Wow. I should really watch where I'm going. What the deuce? Of course! It seems with Death incapacitated, my matricidal efforts are futile. I must do all I can to accelerate his convalescence. ""Knick-knack paddywhack, give a dog a bone"" I can't believe you drank 300 bottles of beer without succumbing to alcohol poisoning. Peter, are you a witch? Yeah. But don't tell anyone. The consequences could be dire! You guys, I bet I can go up to each one of those scary-looking bikers and say: ""Aren't you Richard Simmons?"" - Peter, no! - Now you're being brainless. Aren't you Richard Simmons? Aren't you Richard Simmons' best friend, Richard Simmons?"
S2e6,BIKER:,Shut up! [Laughing.] [Everyone laughing.]
S2e6,DEATH:,"That feels good. Actually, kid, I kind of fell into this gig. I really wanted to be a wood nymph. Man, the second Dad found out, he started in with the whole: ""I have no son. I have no son,"" and Mom just stood there. Yes. Mothers can be quite the botheration, can't they? That's why we've got to get you well. - What was that? - Nothing! Stewie, leave Death alone."
S2e6,DEATH:,"He's okay. He reminds me a lot of me at that age. I hope his teen years go better than mine. Boy, talk about awkward."
S2e6,DEATH:,"Oh, Sandy! Sandy! Sandy? Not again. I'm gonna be a virgin forever. Or am I?"
S2e6,LOIS:,"Can we please talk about Peter? He has so much to live for, Death. He loves his children and me"
S2e6,DEATH:,"Okay. I'll spare his life. But you owe me, if you get my drift. What the hell are you doing? I was talking about another fruit cup. Not bad, though."
S2e6,LOIS:,"Peter, Death just agreed to let you live. Oh, man. This really is my night. I get to live, and I'm on TV. Our top story tonight, the rules of death no longer apply. That's right, Tom. Our own Asian reporter, Trisha Takanawa, filed this report, all by herself! I'm here with Peter Griffin, the man who claims he withstood a barrage of bullets and did not die. Peter, are you saying that if I shoot you in the head with this Channel 5 pistol, you'll be completely unharmed? Why don't you give it a shot? Okay, here goes. [Screaming.] What have I done? [Laughing.] You're awful. - Fascinating story, Tom. - It sure is, Diane. And since the laws of death no longer apply, I can do this. That's right, Tom. And now it's time for sports."
S2e6,DEATH:,"The whole world is laughing at me. This is high school all over again. Well, I'll show them! I'll show all of them! Oh, my God, that hurts! You're not killing anyone tonight, mister! Not on that ankle."
S2e6,DEATH:,This is all your fault. And there's only one solution. You have to go out there and do my job. You have to be Death! [Dramatic instrumental music.]
S2e6,PETER:,"Boy, this doesn't leave much to the imagination. Death, there is no way Peter can do your job. He could never kill anyone. Yeah! I've thought about it, like in church and stuff but I don't think I could ever do what you do."
S2e6,DEATH:,"So you're better than me? I'm tired of always being the bad guy. What I do has to be done. He's right. You've disturbed the natural order. People need to be able to die. [Sentimental instrumental music.] No! - Actually, I think I'm gonna be okay. - Oh, Jack. Now we can get married and everything you promised. Yeah, about that I was pretty sure I was gonna die because there's this girl in New York, and it's getting kind of serious. But thanks for letting me draw you naked. I still can't believe you let me do that! You're saying the only way to make the world right is for me to kill someone?"
S2e6,STEWIE:,You could kill Lois.
S2e6,DEATH:,"No. One death isn't gonna do it. You have to do something that will get everyone's attention, something huge. How about if you blow up the earth?"
S2e6,DEATH:,Too huge. But you're thinking. I like that. You could kill any girls who are prettier than me.
S2e6,DEATH:,"That would just leave England. Wait. I have it. I'm a genius. You'll kill the kids from Dawson's Creek! I knew it! As soon as that show came on the air, I said: ""I'm gonna be the one who has to kill these kids."""
S2e6,LOIS:,It's true. He did say it.
S2e6,DEATH:,"Hot, young celebrities. It's perfect! The kids are on their way to LA to renegotiate their contracts. But their plane is gonna be making a little stopover in Rhode Island."
S2e6,DEATH:,"If you go now, you'll catch them."
S2e6,PETER:,"No way. I'm not doing your dirty work. There's no way I'm getting on that plane. Absolutely no way, and that's final. See? I'm still here. There's nothing you can say that'll change my mind."
S2e6,DEATH:,"You kill them, or I kill you. Crap! Nice plant. Note to self, do not go to the bathroom."
S2e6,MAN:,"James, your last movie killed at the box office. Your Q-rating's through the roof. It's time we ditched the WB and concentrate on features. I don't know who you are, but just because you're sitting across from me doesn't mean you can give me career advice. - Will you sign my ass? - You have a pen? Hello, Death? Guess where I'm calling from?"
S2e6,PETER:,A plane!
S2e6,DEATH:,That's great.
S2e6,DEATH:,Are those kids on board?
S2e6,PETER:,"Yeah. About that, I don't think I can go through with it."
S2e6,DEATH:,"Peter, listen, without death, the world would be a terrible place. Imagine a world where Hitler was still alive."
S2e6,ANNOUNCER:,"Today on Hitler, we'll be talking with Christian Slater. Now, they tell me in your next movie, we get to see your butt. [Girls cheering.]"
S2e6,SLATER:,"Yes, you do."
S2e6,HITLER:,Can we see it right now?
S2e6,SLATER:,All right.
S2e6,HITLER:,He's going to do it!
S2e6,ANNOUNCER:,If you're going to be in L.A. And would like tickets to Hitler call 213-du werdest eine Krankenschwester brauchen!
S2e6,DEATH:,"Peter, all you gotta do is sit there. The plane is gonna crash in LA. Pilot error. Big mess. Everybody dies."
S2e6,PETER:,"Jeez, everybody?"
S2e6,DEATH:,"Except you. Hold on, I'm getting another call. Brenda?"
S2e6,PETER:,It's still me.
S2e6,DEATH:,Brenda?
S2e6,PETER:,"Yes? Just kidding, it's still me."
S2e6,PILOT:,"We now begin our final approach into Los Angeles International. If you look out the window, you'll see the San Fernando Valley where my brother Gary makes a very nice living directing porn. We'll be on the ground in 10 minutes."
S2e6,GIRLS:,"[Singing.] ""We like being alive, we like being alive ""We like being, oh, we like being, oh, we like being alive"" I guess it's their time. [Theme from Dawson's Creek playing.]"
S2e6,PACEY:,"Boy, for a teacher, you sure make love good. Actually, it's ""well,"" Pacey. You mean to say, I make love ""well."" - You're good to go again, right? - Yeah."
S2e6,DEATH:,"Peter? Hello? Peter, are you there? I can hear you breathing? Yeah, I'm here. And you can forget it. I've changed my mind. I don't care if you do kill me, I'm not gonna kill those kids. If they die, I'll have nothing to watch on Wednesdays other than the fine programs on Fox. Open up in there! What are you doing? You're not a pilot. I know every pilot in the world! I'm here to keep you from making an error. A pilot error. Jeez, I probably should've worn mittens!"
S2e6,JAMES:,"Nice going, fat I was just trying to save your lives. But now you're all gonna die. - No one can land this plane. - I can. Thank God! It's Karen Black! She landed a busted plane in Airport '75? It was a movie in the '70s. You damn kids with your music."
S2e6,TOM:,"Both of the pilots were killed. Fortunately for the other passengers, actress Karen Black star of such films as Nashville and Five Easy Pieces, was on board. Hats off to Miss Black for proving once again that, given the opportunity actresses over 50 can land large aircraft. Karen Black. What an obscure reference!"
S2e6,DEATH:,What the hell? I told you to waste the Dawson's Creek kids.
S2e6,LOIS:,You're missing the important thing here. You said you wanted everyone to know the rules of death apply.
S2e6,LOIS:,Now the whole world does.

S2e6,PETER:,"Wait a second. Death? I used to fear you, but now I'm glad we met. Because you've given me a great gift. The complete Boz Scaggs."
S2e6,PETER:,How did you know?
S2e6,DEATH:,I just had a feeling.
S2e6,LOIS:,"We're gonna miss you, Death."
S2e6,DEATH:,"Don't worry. I'll be back really, really soon. [Laughing.]"

S2e7,TOM:,"It was a moving scene today at Hatch Pond as six members of the Pawtucket fire department struggled valiantly to save a fish's life trapped under the frozen ice. Rescue workers got the fish out of the water but unfortunately it died shortly after. Diane? Tom, another life was tragically cut short today. Robert Kimble, founder of a local theater group known as the Quahog Players passed away this afternoon. Oh, my God! [Phone ringing.] Kimble was a hands-on director who often appeared in his own shows most recently, Miss Saigon. [Singing.] ""La la la la la, Miss Saigon ""La la la la la, Miss Saigon"" Yes, I just heard. It's so sad. Really? They want me to be the new artistic director of the Quahog Players! - All right, Mom! - Are you gonna do it? I don't know. It's such a big responsibility. I need a moment to think. Okay, I'll do it. This just in. Lois Griffin is named the new artistic director of the Quahog Players. All those years of paying my dues as musical director under that old hack have finally paid off. Lois, congratulations. Our little theater group finally has a committed visionary at its helm. And such an attractive one. Brian, you'll have to audition just like everyone else. God, of course. I You didn't think You thought I was Lois! - I can paint scenery. - Can I be in the show, Mom? Yes, you can be the dumpy teenager who stays backstage and cries because nobody finds her attractive. [Laughing.] - Hey, you guys. - Peter, guess what? I am gonna Me first! Mr. Weed said whoever comes up with the best idea for the big Christmas toy this year gets a huge bonus. Hey, Dad, why don't you invent the Frisbee? That's an awesome toy. - It's already been invented. - Then how come I never heard of it? This is my chance to prove how valuable I am to the company! Sorry, Lois. What's your news? Well, I Mr. Weed, distinguished members of the board may I present this year's hottest toy Mr. Zucchini Head. He's got stupid cool hip-hop style with his little hat and his Doc Martens. Thank you, Peter, that's enough. Wait. This is the best part! He dances! MAN #1: I've seen enough. MAN #2: Inappropriate. MAN #3: I haven't had sex in ages. Gentlemen, I apologize for wasting your time. Peter is an adequate assembly-line worker but you'll be happy to know our company does not pay him to think. [Laughing.] [Nervous laughter.] I'll take this. No calls. Come on, kids! The director can't be late for the auditions. You should've heard them laughing at me. I got great ideas, but they look at me, and all they see is a loser. Except that guy with the lazy eye. He sees a loser and the snack machine. Peter, a lot of creative people had mindless jobs. Michelangelo worked in a marble quarry. Herman Melville was a customs agent. Albert Einstein worked for the patent office. And what is it you want to patent, Herr Smith? I call it ""Smith's Theory of Relativity."" - Hey, look at this. - What?"
S2e7,BRIAN:,"I think Lois is saying that you have to find a way to express yourself creatively. For example, Chris has his drawing, Meg does her birdcalls, I sing beautifully. So I've heard. And Lois has her theater group. Yes. And for my first production, I've chosen The King and I. It's a wonderful story about a loving, patient woman who introduces culture and civility to a barbaric, patriarchal Peter, please don't wipe your nose on the couch. Look, I have to go. Part of being creative is figuring out what you're good at. I know you can do it if you put your mind to it. You're right. Man was meant to create. That's why God invented Shrinky Dinks. It works! Look how tiny they are! [Sweeping instrumental music.] [Singing.] ""Oh, no not in springtime ""summer, winter, or fall ""No, never would I leave you ""at all"""
S2e7,JOE:,Bravo!
S2e7,LOIS:,"Brian, that was beautiful! Thank you! No, thank you. And that note you gave me, ""louder,"" I was thinking that, and then you said it."
S2e7,BRIAN:,You're so intuitive. It's a pleasure
S2e7,LOIS:,"Okay. Next! Stewie, do you want to try out for Mommy's play? ""Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of York. - ""And all"" - Why don't you sing Itsy Bitsy Spider? How dare you reduce my finely hewn thespian stylings to mere Mother Gooseries! Sing Baa Baa Black Sheep! Mother, as first lady of the American stage, Helen Hayes, once said: ""I'm going to kill you!"" Hey, can somebody give me a hand with all this talent? Peter, what are you doing here? Well, Lois, I tried finding my creativity, like you said. First I took an art class. Am I supposed to draw the penis? Then I tried sculpting. Am I supposed to sculpt the penis? Then I tried music. Am I supposed to conduct with my penis? I started to think there was nothing I'd be good at. But then I realized that this is it. Lois, my penis belongs on stage. Wait, Peter, everyone has to audition. You know, sing, dance. [Laughs.] I get it. Hello, everybody. This is just a formality, since I happen to be doing the director. [Laughs.] Five, six, seven, eight. [Sings out of tune.] ""Marshall, Will, and Holly, on a routine expedition ""Met the greatest earthquake ever known ""High on the rapids, it struck their tiny raft [Yells.] ""And plunged them down a thousand feet below ""to the Land of the Lost"" [Growls.]"
S2e7,LOIS:,"Before I post the cast list my choreographer and I want to thank everyone for auditioning. - You were all great. - Weren't they? I only wish the show was called The King and Us so I could cast you all. [Laughing.] Anna! Baby, baby! I'm a star! Wow. I've never hugged a celebrity before. Except for Pearl Bailey at a book signing once but then we later found out it wasn't actually her. Siamese baby? Stewie Griffin does not play bit parts! You wanted a bigger part, didn't you, sweetie? To hell with you! Perhaps I'll skip the stage and go directly to films! - Hello. - What is that on your ear? Is that hair gel? - Yeah. - Great, 'cause I could use some. - No, don't! - I just ran out. [Sighing.] Man! Chorus! Shoot, what a gyp!"
S2e7,BRIAN:,"The King of Siam? Why, that's the lead! This is so unexpected! Hey, shut up! The King of Siam? Why, that's the lead!"
S2e7,PETER:,"Lois, I think you made a mistake. I'm not ""The King."" I'm not ""I,"" I'm not anybody. - So, what? I had sex with you for nothing? - No, Peter, I It's just that directing this show is a big opportunity for me and I don't want anything to ruin it. - Ruin it? - Yes. By not using you to your full potential. You have too much talent for the stage. You should [Stuttering.] You should be a producer. A producer? Gee, I don't know."
S2e7,PETER:,"Great news, Edgar Bronfman, Jr. We made the deal. We're richer and more powerful than ever! I'm the king of the [Screams.]"
S2e7,PETER:,Damn it! [Gentle dinner music playing.] I love Mexicans. I'll do it! [Pianist playing show music.]
S2e7,JOE:,"Hang on, hang on! You overextended the plié! You screwed it all up. Let me show you again. Okay, boys! Let's do it! And one, two, three. And just like this. And watch my feet. And one, two, three. Peter, Chris says you told him to build a set for the North Pole. Yeah, that's where Anna goes to talk with her best friend, a penguin. There is no talking penguin in The King and I. There is in ""Peter Griffin presents The King and I."" What? Now we gotta think of some funny stuff for him to say. Peter, the director decides whether or not to add a character. You're the producer, remember? What am I supposed to do with all my great ideas? Put 'em in a tub and clean myself with them? 'Cause that's what soap is for, Lois. Good producers put their ideas to work outside the theater. It's your job to make sure we sell every seat in this house. - And that's creative? - Is it? Well, it's just the most creative job there is. Don't you worry, Lois. I'll get the word out. I'll tell two friends, and they'll tell two friends and that's, like, 10 people right there. Hey, I recognize you from the television. You're Tom Tucker. I bet you can do this."
S2e7,PETER:,Excuse me?
S2e7,TOM:,"You. Get out of here! Get out of here! Go on, get out of here! - Wow! Diane Simmons! - You don't look anything like the ad. - You better be huge. - No, I'm Peter Griffin, producer. I'm presenting ""Peter Griffin presents The King and l"" a Peter Griffin production, and I'm giving you the exclusive story. Look, pal, some two-bit community theater production isn't news. Who's the star? For that matter, who the hell are you, and why should I give a damn? Wow, I'm being interviewed by Diane Simmons! Well, Lois, you told me to produce, and I did. I got us a story on the 11:00 news. - Really? - Peter. Our top story tonight. I will be playing the role of Anna in the Quahog Players production of The King and I. - Tom? - Thanks, Diane. In other news, I'm not going to the play because I'm sure it'll be lousy. I'm getting late word that you're a petty, jealous, closet case. Bit of breaking news. We now go live to Diane being a bitch. Diane? But Loretta's playing Anna, and she's doing a great job. Loretta's a nobody. Diane Simmons is a star. You wanted me to sell tickets, right? People who've never been in a theater will come see Diane Simmons. I don't know, Peter, she's a news reporter. Some of our greatest actors started in news, like Sean Penn. Today's weather calls for breezy skies and sun, and there's gonna be a Get that camera out of my face!"
S2e7,PETER:,"Hey, everybody, here's our star! This is so awkward. You all know my name, and I've never heard of any of you. - You ever acted before, honey? - I did an independent film in college. [Melancholic instrumental music.]"
S2e7,LOIS:,"Let's start with the scene where Lady Thiang begs Anna to comfort the king. - Are you playing Lady Thiang? - I was supposed to be Anna. They did an all-you-people version of Hello, Dolly that was very successful. Okay, let's go from the top of Scene 7. Action! ""Oh, Mrs. Anna, the king needs you. You must go to him. ""Lady Thiang, if he needs me, truly needs me, I will go to him."" Cut! All wrong! No good! Peter, what are you doing? She was wonderful. My ass. Besides, I'm the director. It just doesn't feel real, you know? Anna and Miss Thing both love the king, right? On Springer yesterday, they had ""I won't share my husband"" and these two women bitch-slapped each other. The crowd went nuts. - Loretta, why don't you try slapping Diane? - I think I can do that. Wait a minute. Nobody's slapping anybody. This is Rodgers and Hammerstein, not trash TV! I think Peter may be onto something. Springer is one of our station's highest-rated shows. - I don't know. - I thought you wanted to do a good show? - I don't know. - I thought you wanted to do a good show? If you want to do a bad show, why don't we just do Rent? I guess we can try that - Action! Come on, Lois. Those hoop skirts make Diane look a little hippie, you know? I thought we could dress her in a pair of sequined capri pants. They didn't have capri pants in the 1860s. They did now!"
S2e7,STEWIE:,You! You are the worst thing to happen to musical theater since Andrew Lloyd Webber! And you! I just plain don't like you! [Laughing.]
S2e7,LOIS:,What's going on? We're just having a little pow-wow to discuss my latest changes. What changes? The Siamese children. How about this? They're not children. They're aliens!
S2e7,QUAGMIRE:,That was great.
S2e7,BRIAN:,On the money. Isn't he brilliant? No! He's not brilliant! Rodgers and Hammerstein were brilliant! And I want to do the show they wrote! We're not making any more changes!
S2e7,MEG:,"We sold out! Yeah. The whole town's talking about your show, Dad! [Cheering.] Your show? Peter, this is my show! What's the big deal? You wanted to sell out, and we did. I am through selling out. I took this job because I wanted to create something beautiful and you've completely destroyed that! You want to be the director? Fine! I quit! Me, direct? I don't know what to say, except, ""I'm the king of the"" Morning, theater fans! Good morning, Peter. I made your favorite breakfast. - What the hell is this? - French toast. I just made a few creative changes to the recipe. I think it's a lot better now. Lois, if this is your idea of a joke, you must write for Leno. It is so fashionable to take a shot at Jay Leno. Look, the fact is the man is out there every bloody night with fresh material and he's charming. Face it, you're just jealous because people like my ideas better than yours. I don't care if the whole world loves your ideas. That doesn't make them good. I was trying to make art. Art-schmart. Put enough monkeys in a room with a typewriter they'll produce Shakespeare. Let's see. ""A something by any other name"" - ""Carnation,"" ""peony."" - No, they did that on last week's Marlowe. - What about ""daisy""? - ""Chrysanthemum""! - ""Iris,"" ""rose""? What about ""rose""? - Did you say ""rose""? - Yeah, ""rose."" - ""Rose"" is good! - ""A rose by any other name."" That works. - I like that a lot. - Moving on. - What about ""tulip""? ""Rose"" is fine. Moving on. Peter, you've never done a creative thing in your life! That's not true. I wrote Bonfire of the Vanities. No, you didn't. You win this round, Lois. You're not being creative. You're just destroying a wonderful show. I have more creativity in my whole body than most people do before 9:00 a.m. The only thing you create before 9:00 a. M is exactly what you've turned my show into. I think my work will speak for itself. [Fake laugh.] I just got that. A poop joke? That's real creative, Lois."
S2e7,PETER:,"Okay, let's run this scene again. Remember, Diane, you're playing Anna, a steel-town girl on a Saturday night looking for the fight of her life. - Where does it say that? - In my noodle. Okay, places. And action! ['80s pop music playing in theater.]"
S2e7,PETER:,"Stop! All wrong! All wrong! God, send me dancers. We've been rehearsing for hours. I'm exhausted! I'm sorry, but we open this show in three hours and I don't think we're ready!"
S2e7,DIANE:,"No, we're not! You keep changing everything! You bet I do! Because theater is alive. It's a living, breathing creature with wants and needs and you're not man enough to satisfy her! - I can't work this way. I quit! - Fine. - We can't do The King and I without Anna. - Yeah. This is a real snafu. We don't need Diane Simmons. We've had someone better all along. Someone radiant and sassy with the soul and passion that can only come from hundreds of years of black oppression. Thank you, Peter. I'll do it. Get over yourself. I was talking about me. Su-su-sudio. Su-su-sudio."
S2e7,STAGEHAND:,"Two minutes, everybody."
S2e7,PETER:,"Jeez, full house. Look who came crawling back. Peter, have you seen my wheelchair? I don't get it, Mom. If you're mad at Dad for wrecking your show, why'd you come to opening night? I came because I love the theater. If I just came here to enjoy watching your father be humiliated when this asinine spectacle of his is ridiculed by everyone in town what kind of person would I be? A bitch."
S2e7,PETER:,"Siam, 2015 AD. The city lies in ruins after the ninth nuclear World War. It is a grim future with lots of explosions and partial nudity. A future where an oppressive new king has seized power. Only one man can stop him. No, one machine. I am an Automaton Nuclear Neo-human Android. You may call me ANNA. I am a robot ninja from the planet England who is here to destroy you and free this land from your tyranny. I have been expecting you, ANNA. Let me introduce my Siamese children.

This is the kind of mind-numbing schlock that's turning our society into a cultural wasteland! This isn't art! This isn't even entertainment! This blows! [Gasps.] [Farting.] [Continues farting.] [Laughing.] [Cheering.] See? This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about. - How was the cast party? - We're a hit. Man, what a night. I got to see my ideas come to life. It's the greatest feeling in the world. - Yeah, I bet it is. - And it's all thanks to you. I never would've discovered I could be creative if you hadn't believed in me. Actually I didn't really, not at first. But anyone who could take The King and I and turn it into that is well, he's gotta be creative. Yeah, Lois, sorry I took your show away from you but I'll do whatever it takes to make sure you get your chance next year. It'll be ""Peter Griffin presents a Lois Griffin production."" - Okay, honey? - Deal. [Peter chuckling.]"

No. No, it's nothing.  Just had Play-Doh spaghetti last night.  And that's all we had last night.  - What does that mean? - Oh, I don't know, Olivia.  Maybe that we are in a sexless marriage. We have yet to have sex.  Do you even know what sex is?  That's not the point! Don't change the It's a kind of cake?  Look, can we just drop this and have a normal pretend dinner?  Fine, fine! Some days I think it was easier being QBert's roommate.  God, it's all night with this guy.  Hey, if you're gonna leave all those lights on,  I'm not gonna split the electric bill.  Sorry we're late, everyone,  but JonBenet here took forever with her makeup.  Yes, and we probably would've shaved a few minutes off our trip,  but Mr. Cheapo here refused to let the valet touch his Big Wheel,  so we had to drive around the block six times till we could find a spot.  But to his credit, it's a great spot to get mugged.  Oh, wouldn't that be a shame if they took all my money out of both our wallets?

Well, you are a baby, aren't you?  Stay out of it. Stay out of it.  Well, if you think I'm a baby, then perhaps I should act like a baby.  Hey, could you keep that kid quiet? - Oh, what's that?  What's that, sir? What's that? I'm sorry, am I being too loud for you?  You wanna come over here and quiet me down?  - Let's not do this. - Oh, God.  - Stewie, come on. - I'm scared.  No, it's okay.

Yeah, I would.  Well, I know what I'm getting.  Hello, everyone. Well, here we are, opening night.  You know, somebody once told me that making movies was easy.  Yeah.

So, without further dudes, let's watch this thing.  At first, I didn't believe in women and unicorns,  but that was before I knew about the power of chick stuff,  and before I knew Vageena Hertz.

Right stat now!  But it was too late,  and she died from a rotten vagina.  Wow, that was the worst piece of crap I've ever seen.  Oh, my God, that was an abomination.  That was awful. Awful. Awful, awful.  My ass is actually sore.  My ass is actually sore.  - Hey, where's Olivia? - Oh, she's probably up at the house.  - Stewie? - Yeah?  It's not your fault.  - What? - It's not your fault.  I know.  It's not your fault.  I know.  No, Stewie, Stewie.  It's not your fault.  Don't do this to me, man. Not you, man.  - It's not your fault. - Screw you! Cut it out, man!  It's not your fault.  Why is it so hard?  I didn't know it was gonna be so hard.  Look, Stewie, you stood up before God and all your toys  and you took an oath to stick it out when things got tough.  You want her to see you as an adult? Well, this is adulthood.  You're right, Brian. I can't hide from this relationship.  It's my responsibility to deal with it.  I mean, what kind of a man would I be if I ran off now?  Well, you'd be a black man.  - Whoa, what was that? - I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. That was my father talking.  You gotta work on that, man.  Bad dog.  Sweetie, listen, I'm sorry, I  Oh, Stewie!

But you did want it to end. You've made that perfectly clear.  - Listen, are you gonna be all right? - Yeah, I'll be fine.  Is that smoke?  Idea for a farce, cheating wife and pompous ass burned alive.  So, what happened?  Well, you want to know what I learned this week?  Being a grown-up sucks.  Women, Brian, what a royal pain in the ass!  It's like, why can't you just hang out with guys?  You know, just live with someone of your own sex.  Just do what you would do with women,  but with your buddy. You know, why don't guys just do that?  They do. It's called being gay.  Oh, that's what gay is?  Oh, yeah, I could totally get into that."

Why doesn't Victor go get some punch for you and me? Or maybe you and I could go away from Victor and go get the punch? Or-or none of us could have punch. But still Victor could go away. Victor, would you excuse us for a second? Uh, sure. Idea for a novel : guy loses his favorite blankie, goes looking for it and finds it in the kitchen. Is that I amaze myself. Is that It's genius. It's unbelievable. I don't know where I get it from. What the hell is wrong with you? You're acting like a jerk. Oh, I'm acting like a jerk? What about Phony Curtis over there? He happens to be a very intelligent, successful actor. And, you know, he's done three national diaper commercials. Yeah, let's put a diaper on his face. That's where the crap is coming out. You don't own me. I can talk to whoever I want. I don't see a ring on my finger. I, Stewie, take you, Olivia, to be my lawfully wedded wife. Uh, what's that, Rupert? Oh, oh, kiss the bride. Yes. - Hi, honey! I'm home! - Hi, sweetie, how was your day? Well, I was an astronaut for a while, then I was a cowboy, and then all afternoon I was a fireman, so it's been, uh it's been a long one. - Uh, what's for dinner? - Playdoh spaghetti. - Oh. - What? No. No, it's nothing. Just had Playdoh spaghetti last night. - And that's all we had last night. - What does that mean? Oh, I don't know, Olivia. Maybe that we are in a sexless marriage. We have yet to have sex. Do you even know what sex is? That's not the poi Don't change the It's a kind of cake? Look, can we just drop this and have a normal pretend dinner? Fine, fine! Uch, some days I think it was easier being Q-Bert's roommate. God, it's all night with this guy. If you're gonna leave all those lights on, I'm not gonna split the electric bill. Sorry we're late, everyone, but JonBenet here took forever with her makeup. Uh, yes, and we probably would've shaved a few minutes off our trip, but Mr. Cheapo here refused to let the valet touch his Big Wheel, so we had to drive around the block six times till we could find a spot. But to his credit, it is a great spot to get mugged. Wouldn't that be a shame, if they took all my money out of both our wallets. Well, it's just good to have you guys here. Can I get you folks something to drink? - Uh, yes, I'll just have flat water. - Um, do you have Hi-C Tropical Punch? And it begins What? I can't have a drink with dinner? So dinner started at 2:00 this afternoon, did it? Yes, about the same time you decided to hole up in the bathroom - for three hours waxing your eyebrows. - You swore you would never I have a prominent brow, and I do what I can to get by. Well, hey, what's important is that you're here now. - Let's just enjoy dinner. - Yeah, can't we just have a good time? Ask Olivia. Olivia, the three of us are having a great time. What's your problem? My problem is you. You're acting like a baby. And we come to the center of the shrubbery maze. That's what it all comes down to, isn't it? I'm not grown up enough for you. - Well, you are a baby, aren't you? - Stay out of it. Stay out of it. Well, if you think I'm a baby, then perhaps I should act like a baby. Hey, could you keep that kid quiet? Oh, oh, oh, what's that? What's that, sir? What's that? I'm sorry, am I being too loud for you? You wanna come over here and quiet me down? - Oh, let's do this. - Oh, God. Stewie, come on. - I'm scared. - No, it's okay. It's okay. Sir? You feel strong? You wanna come over here? No, I want to stay here and have my steak. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - What is that, the porterhouse? - Yeah. - How is it? - What do you care? If we weren't fighting, would you recommend it? Yeah, I would. Well, I know what I'm getting. Hello, everyone. Well, here we are opening night. You know, somebody once told me that making movies was easy. Yeah. Yeah, you know what else is easy? Open heart surgery. - Oh-ho-ho! Yes! - Yeah, thanks for coming, Fuad. Oh! Is funny because open heart surgery not easy at all. Yeah, yeah. Calm down, Fuad. So, without further dudes, ah, let's, uh, watch this thing. At first I didn't believe in women and unicorns, but that was before I knew about the power of chick stuff, and before I knew Vageena Hertz. Sorry. When Vageena was first born, I had a small heart and a lot to learn. Push, honey! Hurry up and give me my baby boy! Cleveland, more SpaghettiO's. Oh, good, a baby. Oh, no, it's a girl. And I hate girls. But one day, Vageena went swimming too soon after eating a sandwich and this happened. Help! Help! I'm drowning! Help! We gotta get this woman to surgery time. Right stat now! But it was too late. And she died from an angry hymen. Fin. Wow, that was the worst piece of crap I ever seen. Oh, my God, that was an abomination. - That was awful. Awful. Awful, awful. - My ass is actually sore. My ass is actually sore. - Hey, where's Olivia? - Oh, she's probably up at the house. - Stewie? - Yeah? - It's not your fault. - What? - It's not your fault. - I know. - It's not your fault. - I know. No, Stewie, Stewie. It's not your fault. Don't do this to me, man. Not you, man. - It's not your fault. - Screw you! Cut it out, man. - It's not your fault. - Why is it so hard? I didn't know it was gonna be so hard. Look, Stewie, you stood up before God and all your toys and you took an oath to stick it out when things got tough. You want her to see you as an adult? Well, this is adulthood. You're right, Brian. I can't hide from this relationship. It's my responsability to deal with it. I mean, what kind of a man would I be If I ran off now? Well, you'd be a black man. - Whoa, what was that? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That was my father talking. You, uh you gotta work on that, man. Bad dog. Sweetie, listen, I'm sorry, I Oh, Stewie! I thought you were at Chuck E. Cheese's with your mom. No. A four-year-old died in the ball pit. We had to cancel. Is that the Silly Putty I bought you this weekend? Stewie, this isn't what it looks like. Uh-uh, yeah, Stewie, I just dropped by to Uh, uh, uh, ain't nobody talking to you. Is that the Silly Putty I bought you this weekend? You know, I'm really sensing something here I should be go. No, about you stay here and I leave and never come back again? Stewie, this isn't how I wanted it to end. But you did want it to end. You've made that perfectly clear. - Listen, are you gonna be all right? - Yeah, I'll be fine. Is that smoke? Idea for a farce : cheating wife and pompous ass burned alive. So what happened? Well, you wanna know what I learned this week? Being a grown-up sucks. Women, Brian. What a royal pain in the ass. It's like, it's like, why can't you just hang out with guys, you know? Just live with someone of your own sex. Just do what you would do with women, but with your buddy, you know, why don't guys just do that? They do, it's called being gay. Oh, that's what gay is? Yeah, I could totally get into that."
S10e1,II:,"The Wrath of Khan, edited for goats. KHAN (over speaker): Marooned for all eternity in the center of a dead planet. Buried alive. Buried alive. (bleating) Lois, I need $28,000. For what? I've decided I want to open a sushi restaurant. What do you know about sushi? I don't care about the sushi. I just want to yell at customers when they walk in the door. (speaking faux Japanese) Here comes a black guy! Peter, you're not getting money for that or anything else. We're running seriously low on cash right now. In fact, I may have to get my own full-time job. Geez. Are we really living that close to the edge? You know we are, Brian. Why do you think we waited so long to take you to the groomer's last month? Hey, isn't it time for me to get a haircut? Oh, no. I think you just got one. Are you sure? 'Cause I feel like my nails are really long. Yeah, I'll check, but I'm pretty sure it's not for another couple of weeks. (panting) What day is this? Like it or not, we're going to have to start living on a strict budget for a while. Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker, and this is  News  I thought you were going to sing with me, Joyce. Okay. Our top story tonight. The Rhode Island State Lottery has climbed to a record $150 million jackpot. That's right, Tom. Powerball fever has officially gripped Quahog. We sent Channel Five News Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa around town to get the public reaction. Mayor West, what do you plan to do if you win the lottery? Well, I'd finally splurge and buy myself one of those fancy four-piece suits. I'd like to join your country club. I assume that won't be a problem. And how about you, every Persian guy in the world?"
S10e1,ALL:,"White BMW. There you go, Lois. That's the answer right there. We'll just win the lottery. In fact, I'm going to go buy my winning ticket right now. Peter, what's wrong? It's, uh, nothing. I'm just going to wait a minute. There's teenagers in skinny jeans out there. Everyone, I got big news. We are going to be rich. Oh, my God, Peter. There are thousands of lottery tickets here. Where did you get the money for all these? Simple. I took out a second mortgage on the house. What?! Peter, this is idiotic. Your odds of winning are like 100 million to one. Don't you know the lottery is just a tax on stupid people? Would you be saying that if the prize was 150 million bags of the neighbor's garbage? But it's not. I mean I mean, is it? It's that-that is an unrealistic, unfair question. Peter, Brian's right. How can you be so irresponsible? You take these tickets back right now. No way, Lois. We're going to win. I got lots of good karma built up from doing those USO shows. (laughter) So, apparently, they found a weapon of mass destruction-- my putter. (laughter) All right, boys. Go get 'em over there. And now, please welcome Mr. Bruce Jenner. (cheering and applause) (jazzy burlesque music plays) (sailors cheering and whistling) Just wanted to remind you fellas what you're all fighting for. Okay, this is it, you guys. They're going to announce the winning lottery numbers. Time for the Griffin family to meet its destiny. When we lose, I'm getting a divorce. Understood. We're here live in our studio where a checkout girl in a cheap dress who wants to be a model is ready to draw the winning numbers. ""E!"""

She's good at 17. Well, folks, those are our winning numbers. Good luck to all of our Twenty-four! No, that's it. We're done. Anyone watching, do not count 24. Somebody turn the machine off. N-Nikki, Nikki, that's good. That's good. Go go wait in my car. All right, you did good. Going to take her to Walt's Roast Beef. All right, kids, we got 200,000 lottery tickets we got to check. All right, how do you want to do this? A static shot of the house where night turns into day or a montage song that over-explains what we're doing? Um, that second one sounds like it could be funny.    Checking lottery tickets   Looking at the numbers   And seeing if they match the ones on the news   If they do, then we're winners   If they don't, then we put them   In the designated pile   For tickets we already checked   This is taking forever   That's why Brian is yawning   And Stewie's rubbing his eyes   The montage is almost over   That's why the music and the vocals   Are fading out right now.  Well, that's it. Three days wasted looking through 200,000 lottery tickets. Those weren't the lottery tickets. That was a test. These are the lottery tickets. Is this another test? Yes. These aren't the real lottery tickets, either. These are the real lottery tickets. So, in addition to buying you had 400,000 fake ones printed up? I had to be sure. Oh, my God. We won! What? Let me see that. Yes! We won the lottery! I'm getting a penis butler. Sir? All right, butle my penis. Butle it! This is awesome. Now that we're rich, our lives are going to be so much better. You sure it was such a good idea to cash that lottery check? It seems foolish to have all this money lying around. Oh, you'd rather have it down at the bank where the Jewish guys can leer at it? Yeah! All right! Money! (whistling) Whoo-hoo! Whoo! (phone rings) Hello?"
S10e1,CARTER:,"Did you blow all your money yet? No, Daddy. All right. Call me when you blow all your money. Love you. Bye. All right, so how are we going to spend our winnings? I'm going to get some supermarket fried chicken and eat it until I'm nauseous. I'm going to finally get my gal that doodad she's been wantin'! I'm going to get a floor mirror to squat over and see what's making all that noise. Okay, everybody just calm down. We're not going to go crazy spending our winnings, and we're not going to let this money change us. What are you talking about? This money is our ticket to the good life, starting now. I just bought a giant room full of gold coins, and I'm going to dive into it like Scrooge McDuck. (drumroll) Aah! It's not a liquid! It's a great many pieces of solid matter that form a hard, floor-like surface! Aah! Peter, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work? I quit my job, Lois. You what? Yeah, we're rich now. I don't need to be working. Ah, you should've been there, Lois. I told Angela what she could do with that job, just like I always fantasized. Angela, I just want to thank you for several extremely pleasurable years working for this corporation. Uh, certain unexpected developments have created a situation where I am no longer in need of employment. Uh, I would be remiss, however, if I did not extend my gratitude to you for your unwavering fairness and belief in me, and there is a giant poo on your desk. Hey, Horace, another round for everybody. (patrons cheering) Gosh, Peter, you're really being generous with your money. Hey, what's the point of being rich if you can't share it with your pals, huh? Okay, wait, I-I got one. Who would you rather do? Susan Boyle or a sex doll that's been passed around a fraternity? Well, have they been cleaning the doll? Please, these guys are Betas-- they're total animals. Hey, I got one, Peter. What would you rather do? Tread water where you are right now or increase your net worth fivefold within the next Huh? What? I what are you talking about? Well, my friend Marty is a whiz with chemistry, and he says he's come up with a new penis enlargement pill, and if we can bankroll him $100,000 in startup money, he'll triple our investment in a year. Well, uh gee, I-I'm I don't, uh Peter, I've taken the liberty of mocking up some sales projections. Wow, that's pretty good. And this would be our net profits. Yikes. You know, Peter, uh, Bonnie's birthday is coming up, and I'll be gol-darned if I didn't go ahead and promise her that Stevie Nicks would come to our house and sing three songs to her. (chuckling): Boy, do I got a big mouth, huh? Yeah, if you're going to open your mouth with the missus, stick to kisses, huh? (laughs) (both laughing) What neat humor. What neat humor. So what do say, Peter? Can you help us out? Of course I can, you dope. We're pals, right? There you go. Hey, Horace, give us three shots of your best bourbon. And have that Russian waiter I like bring it over. (jaunty intro plays)  La la la la la la la la la la la   Trololo   La la la la la la la la la la la   Ho ho ho ho ho   Ho ho ho ho ho   Ho ho ho ho ho   Ho ho ho ho ho   La la la la la la la la la la la la   La la la la la la la la la la   Ah la la la   La la la la la la   La la la la la   Bop ba da da da da da da da   La la la la la la.  Boy, you wouldn't guess from that smile that all his kids were stillborn, huh? All right, well, thanks again, Peter. I got to head out. I told my mother I'd visit her in the hospital. Yeah, and I got to work. I'm flying a leg to Minneapolis tonight. Oh. Yeah, I-I-I understand. You you've got other things to do. I-I just wrote you guys a couple of checks, but no, you you-you-you do your things. What? No, I mean, I-I'm just saying, I-I thought friends hang out, do things with each other. You know, especially when one friend gives the other friends a whole bunch of money. Oh. Well, I guess I could stick around. Yeah, and I-I guess the co-pilot can fly the plane. She's a woman and passengers are usually okay with that. I once saw a deodorant commercial that had a woman pilot. That's more like it. From now on, we're all gonna do whatever I want to do. 'Cause I'm the one with the dough. Okay, I guess that's fair. Good. 'Cause what I want to do is stay here, get drunk and watch TV."
S10e1,ANNOUNCER:,"We now return to Michael McDonald During Allergy Season. (gasping): Haa Haa-haa Haa-haa-haa-haa-haa Haa (sneezes):  Haa-chu!  Hey, Peter, you wanted me to watch the entire first season of True Blood and come show you where there was boob? That's right, I don't want to see any actual True Blood, just boob. Yeah, well, I found some. No! Anna Paquin boob does not count as real boob! That's like looking at a 12-year-old boy. Geez. Y-You should know that, Joe! You should definitely know that! Sorry, Peter. Sorry doesn't show me nipples worth seeing! And as for you, Anna, you're dreadful and so is the program. I didn't write it. Yeah, but you know the people who do. That Alan Ball-- you know him, right? Yeah. How come everything he writes is so dreary? I don't know. Tell him to cheer up! Things ain't so bad! This is a weird episode. Okay, Quagmire, I want you to take the first bite out of this fudge pop, because that first bite is the one that really hurts. Well, okay. (grunting) Ah! Ow! Ow! Yeah, that's right ""Ow."" Now, you swallow that. Don't you dare spit that out. What's the difference? You got what you wanted. I said swallow it! (gulps) Now, smear what's left of it on your face and look at me with your mouth open. Look at yourself, you filthy whore. I don't even want this now. Okay, guys, now you're gonna do a synchronized duet of ""Makin' Whoopee"" while I shoot you with this BB gun. That doesn't sound safe. Action! (piano playing)  Another bride   She looks so gay   Another June   Oh, what a day   Another sunny honeymoon   Hip hip hoor  (screams)  Another seas  (screams)  Another reason   For making whoopee  Look, you aren't gonna shoot us in the eye, are you, Peter? Oh, no, Joe. I wouldn't try to shoot you in the eye.  A lot of shoes   We're throwing shoes   A lot of rice   It's all so ni  (screams) Peter, it was really close to my eye! Relax, Joe. I'm nowhere near your eye. Hey, Joe, open your eye. (screaming) Gotcha. What the hell, Peter?! You shot him in the eye! Keep singing, you. And keep your chin up, so I can see your throat. No, no screw this! You're a jerk! Jerk? What kind of a way is that to talk to your friend who gives you money? Go to hell, Peter! We don't need your money! And we don't need friends like you! Yeah! We're out of here! Fine, go on. I don't care. I don't need you, I got money! You know, Peter, you used to be a great guy. But ever since you won that lottery (screaming) Come on, Joe! (bleep) this guy! Aah! I'm here to audition for Fiddler on the Roof. Come right in. Peter, my God, what the hell are you wearing? It's a solid gold tuxedo, Lois. I had to fight three rappers down at the Nonsense Store for this. Look, Peter, this is not who we are. I'm worried the money is changing this family, and not the way you hoped. Well, I was hoping it would make you shut up, so you're right. You know, I spoke to Bonnie this morning, and she said you haven't talked to Joe or Quagmire in two weeks. Who cares? I don't need Quagmire. And I certainly don't need Joe. I got Money Joe. (laughs) That's a good one, Money Joe! I don't like what this money is doing to us. It's even affecting Brian and Stewie. (yawns) I think I'm gonna take a nap. What, here? Yeah, I had a giant mobile put in the sky so I can sleep wherever I want. (mobile playing soft music) (sighs) This is nice. I hope that bear comes around soon. That's sort of my fave-- Oh, look, the bear! And it's not just them. Chris has also been developing some very expensive tastes. Model glue, sir? Well, what do we have today? Today we have a recent vintage procured just this morning from Michael's Hobby Shop. Yes, that's very nice. Bring me my finest rag. Your fancy rag, sir. You are relieved for the evening. (inhales deeply) You don't see poor people doing this! Lois, don't you understand? We don't got any of our old problems anymore. We don't have to worry about paying bills, we don't have to worry about saving dough. All we got to do is enjoy ourselves. Interested? (gasps) Oh, my God. Peter, it's beautiful! Is it a blood diamond? Ah, the bloodiest. The two kids who found it were forced to murder each other. Oh, Peter, I love it. Hey, you want to watch a DVD of the murder while we do it? I already watched it eight times, so I know exactly which part I want to blam at. Chris, Meg, now that I'm a rich father, you will try to impress me, and I will remain distant. Go. Um, say, Dad, did I tell you I got second place in the yacht race? Hmm. Sounds like somebody's dad is happier than me right now. Well, um, how about this, Dad? The school paper is doing a story about me. That's because I had it arranged. Uh, I was thinking about joining the Army? No. Meg, as a girl, your life holds no merit. And, Chris, try as you may, you will never be as good as your older brother who died. He was good at sports and talking. Now, pardon me while I look at scrimshaw through a magnifying glass. Ah, brave men all. Lost sons of New Bedford. That's good scrimshaw. Ah, I never thought I'd be having high tea at the Park Barrington every single day. Yes, it's nice to eat in a sea of white faces, isn't it? Waiter, have the chef prepare a bucket of your finest caviar, and then give it a helicopter tour of the city. Very good, sir. Very good indeed. I hope it enjoys it as much as that Maine lobster I ordered. And over there is the Rhode Island State House, the second largest self-supporting marble dome in North America. Why the (bleep) am I doing this? I could've just said I did it. Sir, about your bill Oh, don't worry, Carstairs, there's ample gratuity on there for you. (chuckles): Nyah. Well, actually, sir, your card has been declined. (laughs): Oh, really? Well, I'm sure a brief call to my accountant will resolve this to our mutual satisfaction. Hello, Schnozzenstein? This is Peter Griffin. There seems to be some issue with our credit. I told Carstairs you'd set everything straight. What do you mean I'm broke?! What about all that money I sent to the Gayman Islands? They did what with it?! No, I don't want it back! I'm gonna miss you, Carstairs. I shall miss you, too, sir. With no one to look after, Carstairs fell into a deep depression from which he never emerged. He died two weeks later. Some say of a broken heart. What, sir? But that was Carstairs. I can't believe it. We lost everything. What do we do now? Well, seems like our only hope is the lottery. Holy (bleep), we won twice and we're right back here again. We had $150 million, and we blew through it in a month. Yeah, but on the bright side, if this hadn't happened, we never would've met Kyle. Hey. Hello. Hey there. Hi. What's up? And that's not even Kyle. Peter, we can't live like this. Well, what are we supposed to do, Lois? Everything we had is gone! We have friends, Peter. Not anymore, we don't. They're good people. They'll listen. And they'll care what happens to us, even after everything that's happened. You know, I'm still young enough you can drop me at the fire station, no questions asked. Well, well. Look who it is. Who is it? It's me, Peter. I'm standing right here. This is a glass eye, Peter. They had to remove the one you shot. Oh, boy, that whole day was a mess, huh? What happened to you, anyway? You look terrible. Look, you guys, I messed up bad. Winning the lottery was the worst thing that ever happened to me and my family. I thought being rich would solve all my problems, but all it did was make me forget what was important. Like who my real friends are. I don't expect you to forgive me, but if, for some reason, you do, you can find me in a cardboard box on the corner of Meeting and Thayer. Peter, wait. That corner's a bit of a hike for me. I'd rather just come see you at home. What-- where'd you get this kind of money? The penis enlargement pill you gave me the startup money for. It turned a pretty nice profit. I guess it's only fair that I give you my percentage so you can get your house back. Quagmire, I don't know what to say. Thank you. You're welcome. And if it makes you feel better, it was money well spent. Just ask Sandra the waitress over there. We had a great time last night."
S10e1,PETER:,"Tough girl. Made it into work. Boy, I got to say, it's good to be home. Yeah. Despite all the ups and downs, things turned out for the best. I mean, really, we're no worse off than we were before. Plus, we learned something. And you can't put a price on that. Look, Lois, we all know what happened. We're all depressed. All right, let's just go to different rooms and stare blankly out the window, saying nothing. Congratulations to tonight's sweepstakes winner, Daniel San Martin Marrero."
S10e1,MODEL:,Shapes. Shut up.
S10e3,PETER:,"Hey, Quagmire? You in there? (gasps) Holy crap! Oh, my God! He must have autoerotically asphyxiated himself! Yeah, while he was watching clown porn. Oh, yeah, baby. Oh yeah, baby! You make me so horny! (bicycle horn blowing) Come on, help me get him down! Peter, he's still alive! We got to get him to a hospital! All right, but let's just watch the end of this clown porn first. (calliope music playing) Oh, Peter, we came as soon as we heard. How is he? He's in a coma, Lois. My God, what the hell happened? He hung himself during autoerotic asphyxiation. Just goes to show anything can be dangerous. Is his family here? His sister Brenda is coming with her boyfriend, Jeff. Oh, my God, not that guy. Is she still with him? Isn't he the one that beats her? Yeah, but she's gotten a lot better. All right, on the way back, I get to pick the radio station, because that was awful. I know, yeah, it was, I'm sorry. Oh, God, I just I hope Glenn's okay. I'm so worried about him. Shut up and limp! We're in a handicapped spot, you slut! Well, Miss Quagmire, your brother Glenn is lucky to be alive. You know, we're all lucky to be alive on such a beautiful day. In fact, nurse-- all surgeries are outside today. You know, when we were kids, our mother used to sing a song when we were sad. Maybe that'll help now. Come on, Brenda, a stupid nursery rhyme isn't going to wake him up, especially the way you sing. (laughing) Right, man? Gyaaaa.  Glenn, don't die from autoerotic asphyxiation   Your friends want to go fishing with you  This song is from childhood?  Live to see tomorrow, October 31, 2011.  Where am I? What happened? Oh, Glenn! Oh, thank God you're all right! Hey, you touching my girl?! Relax, Jeff. That's her brother. Yeah, that's how it starts. Come on, Brenda, we got to get out of here. I need cigarettes and jeans. Oh, thanks, you guys, for all your help through this. Oh, Glenn, we're just so glad you're all right. And Jeff and I are happy to stay here with you for as long as you need. Fine, then you call my cousin Terry and tell him we're not going to be at his karate recital! Well, Jeff, he is my brother. Why do you always got to remind me I didn't finish high school? Well, listen, how about I make us all some dinner, huh? Come here! (clattering) You fat, ugly bitch! If today wasn't your birthday Jeff! Please, you're being What?! What am I being?! Crazy?! Unemployed?! Why don't you call the cops like you did on Christmas?! I-I-I didn't call them! They were called! Oh, now you're calling me a liar in front of this cat?! I got another cat. Aw, that yellow lab looks like it's dying. Peter, that's Gwyneth Paltrow. She's fine. Look, turn off the light. I just want to get to sleep and put this ugly night behind us. All that unpleasantness with Brenda and Jeff was more than I can handle. It's no big deal, Lois. We probably just caught 'em on an off night."
S10e3,JEFF:,Where do you get off calling me a deadbeat in front of your brother?!
S10e3,BRENDA:,"No, Jeff, a-a-all I said was that you were in between jobs!"
S10e3,JEFF:,"Well, it wouldn't matter if you'd just pick up that night shift at the prison!"
S10e3,BRENDA:,But then I'll be working a hundred hours a week.
S10e3,JEFF:,So what?! I need money for motor oil and wallet chains!
S10e3,BRENDA:,"Okay, I'll ask about it Monday. Can I put my nightgown back on?"
S10e3,JEFF:,"No, I'm not done drawing! (doorbell rings) Hey, Peter. Geez, Quagmire, you look terrible. Oh, I didn't get any sleep. Hi, Glenn. How are you? Not great, Lois. I'm stuck in the middle of some bad stuff with my sister. I know, it sounded like there was quite a ruckus going on over there last night. That Jeff seems like kind of a monster. Yeah, that guy's scary as an Iraq Lobster. (playing ""Rock Lobster"")  Death to America   And butter sauce   Don't boil me   I'm still alive   Iraq Lobster   Iraq Lobster.  I've tried talking to Brenda about leaving him, but I haven't gotten anywhere. I was actually hoping you could talk to her, Lois. She might open up more to you, you know, 'cause you're a woman. - Me? - Yeah, would you mind at least trying? Well, I guess she does need someone to talk to. Well, let's hope she's good at talking 'cause we know she doesn't listen so good. That we know. You know, Brenda, I'm glad we could get together. Me, too, Lois. It's nice to have a girlfriend to chat with. Don't you have any back home? Oh, no. Jeff would never allow that. You know, that's kind of what I want to talk to you about, Brenda. Do you mind taking off your sunglasses? Oh, my God. No, i-it's really not that bad. It only hurts when I see. You know, you don't have to stay with a man who treats you that way. Oh, Jeff's sweet. You don't see how soft and gentle he hits me when we're alone. Do you hear yourself? He shouldn't be hitting you at all. I don't think you understand how serious a matter Close your menu. What? Close your menu, so they know we're ready to order. I'll give you another moment. Damn it. I'm sorry. Oh, shoot. See, this is why Jeff corrects me all the time. Corrects you? Brenda, he's not correcting you, he's beating you! Well, I-I-I can see why you'd think that 'cause of the punches and all, but it's just that Jeff's been so angry about immigrants. What?! It'll be better when he gets back to work. Our relationship is just complicated, that's all. No, Brenda, it's not complicated. Trying to get a straight answer out of a 23-year-old girl is complicated. So, do you want to go out some time? Out like, go out or hang out or just do something? Like a date. Like a date date? Or like a date? Both, I I guess. Yeah, sure, maybe. I don't know. Yes, no. Here's the first three digits of my phone number. E-mail me. Joe, the guy's a menace. They've been with me three days now, and all he does is beat her day and night. And on top of that, they say they don't need to be entertained, but then they're always like, ""Hey, so what're we doing? What's next?"" Hey, Joe, can't you can't you just arrest the guy? I can't arrest Jeff unless Brenda files a formal complaint with the police. She won't go to the police. She's afraid of what Jeff will do. And to be honest, I don't blame her. I mean, w-w-what happens if one of these nights, he hits her so hard he kills her? Sorry, Quagmire. Police policy, we can't step in until it's too late. But if I were you, I'd set up an intervention. What's that? It's like a surprise birthday party, but instead of cake and presents, there's angry letters and someone who inappropriately tries to make it about themselves. Aw, that sounds great! I bet I would really shine at one of those. All right, well, first we want to thank you all for being here for Brenda. Now, I know it's going to be a long day, but we're all here because we care about her very much. What the what's going on? What's all this? Brenda, this is an intervention. A lot of us don't like how Jeff's been treating you. So we're going to say a few things, and then you'll say a few things, and then we'll be done. Sound good? Um I guess. All right, so we're going to go around the room and tell you exactly how your situation has affected each of us. Meg? I feel like if he likes you, maybe you can change him. Okay, maybe she wasn't the one to start with. Caleb? Caleb, you want to go ahead? M M me? Yeah, go ahead. Uh It's Chris. Y-You don't know my name? All right, this isn't off to a flying start. Peter, why don't you go ahead? So, you like getting beaten, huh? Well, why don't you smoke a whole carton of cigarettes! Look, I know what you guys are trying to do, but Jeff and I are fine. No, Brenda, you're not fine, okay? Please, I'd like to say something, if I may. (clearing throat) ""Brenda, the fact that you are being abused ""has affected my life in the following ways: ""The sister that I knew and loved growing up ""no longer exists. ""The person I see before me now is just a punching bag. ""And I call you 'person' and not 'woman' ""because a woman is a strong, beautiful, vibrant creature. ""A woman embraces life. ""A woman makes choices to make her life better. ""Sadly, the fact that you are with Jeff, proves to me that you have made a choice to make your life worse."" I-I want the girl I grew up with back. I want I want my sister back. Brenda, I love you. Please make the right decision. Which is a perfect time for me to tell my jokes. Peter! And I will save them for the end. Glenn, I am so lucky to have such a wonderful, loving brother like you. So, are you gonna leave him? Oh, there you are! Hey, give me some money! I saw a cool bandana. What the hell's going on here?! Listen here, you bully! For your information, Brenda just agreed to leave you! Like hell she did. Brenda, you tell 'em? No, not yet. Everyone I have wonderful news. Jeff and I are getting married. (all gasp) I'd show you the ring, but it's under the splint. My finger fell down the stairs. You're getting married?! Yeah, but only 'cause she's pregnant. Pregnant?! Oh, congratulations! Have you thought of any names yet? Maybe maybe ""Slappy""? Or-or ""Bruisey""? Or ""Keep-It-Down- In-There-sy""? Guys, what the hell am I gonna do? She can't marry that bastard. He's just gonna keep beatin' her, and then he's gonna beat the kid, too! God, I wish she'd never met Jeffrey Fecalman. You know, I was thinking Wait, what? What? That's his name? Yeah. Huh-larious. But you know, I was thinking this afternoon, what the hell happened to the days when a guy does something like that to a girl, and a bunch of us guys get together and just go kick his (bleep) ass? Boy, that'd be satisfying. Well why not? What do you mean? The three of us. We go over there and we do what's right; we kill the bastard. Whoa, whoa, Quagmire. You know, I could arrest you just for saying that. You know what else you can get arrested for? Soliciting a rooster. I don't know what this cock-a-doodle-doo thing is, but it sounds gay and it sounds scatological. I'm in. You're about to have a neat day. Quagmire, you're talking about murdering a guy. It doesn't matter what he's done, it's still murder. No, Joe, it does matter what he's done! These kinds of guys don't change. Y-you think they ever suddenly wake up and realize the error of their ways and clean up their act? No! They just keep ruining everyone's lives, and the world is better off without 'em. It's against the law, Quagmire, and that's the end of it. (loud slap, Brenda screams)"
S10e3,JEFF:,"What the hell?! Did you change the channel while I was going to get a beer?! Oh, yeah, I-I'm sorry, honey, I just wanted to see who was on Letterman. We're watching Leno, you bitch! I'm so sorry! His soft, gentle humor connects effortlessly with my mainstream sensibilities! (slaps) (screams) Let's waste this dick. Boy, everything's different now than it used to be, isn't it? You know, this morning I had a bowl of Fruity Pebbles cereal. Yeah, yeah. When I was a kid, they were boulders! (laughs loudly) (laughs) Cereals do change. Oh, no, no. Here's something, here's something. Did you hear about this? Here's a bunch of words in a row: because the economy's so bad, they've decided they're gonna shut down all the prisons. Yeah, yeah. And-and they're gonna send all the inmates to Congress. I don't get that one! Hi, there, Jeff. Hey, what's going on, dudes? Brenda just fell. Get your lazy ass up and get my neighbors some beers! Actually, we don't have time, Jeff. We were just about to go on our annual midnight hunting trip. We thought you might want to join us. Yeah, what the hell. Go shoot some animals, that sounds like fun. Hey, it beats sitting at home watching Meg pop her zits. (squish) Okay, okay, who would you rather do? Dame Judi Dench with 30 minutes of kissing first or Eddie Izzard in drag, but he has a working vagina? Would Eddie Izzard tell others about it? Eddie Izzard is very discreet. Then that's your answer. You know, Quagmire, I gotta say, I was pretty surprised you wanted me to come along. I thought you hated my guts. (chuckles) Oh, come on, Jeff, I don't hate your (bleep) guts. Well, then what the hell are we doing out here? I thought we were gonna kill Ah! So, Jeff, do you like loud sentences?! I guess. I gotta take a whiz. All right, look, when he comes back, I'm just gonna do it, okay? I'm just gonna point my gun straight at his head before he even knows what's going on. (shotgun racks) Kinda like this? You know, Quagmire, you are pathetic. You have to bring your friends out here with you to do your dirty work? What what do you mean, Jeff? You're gonna kill me, is that it? Uh-uh! Not unless you want your friend's brains all over the place! Listen, Jeff, just put the gun down and we'll forget this whole thing, okay? Oh. Well, that's never happened before. Kinda don't know what to do next. So now you'll forget the whole thing? Yeah, I, uh, guess that is what I said. No, no, we can't forget the whole thing! Yeah, you know, he's right. We can't forget it. Fine. Now here's the plan: I'm taking Quagmire for a little ride, and you guys are gonna stay out here and freeze to death! Now, get those hands where I can see 'em! All the way up! Oh, my shirt's a little too short. That's okay. You can keep 'em the way you had 'em so it covers your stomach. Thank you. You know, if this Jeff was around more, we wouldn't have tried to kill you. See you later, schmucks! All right, this is far enough. Well, Quagmire, sorry it had to end this way; a tragic hunting accident. I guess that little baby's gonna grow up without an uncle. Actually, I have a brother. Gary Quagmire. Oh. I think I think you got a brother, too, don't you? All right, forget the uncle thing! Get ready to die, Quagmire. You know, if you had any balls, you'd put that gun down and we could settle this like men. (laughs) That's awful big talk for a scrawny bastard like you. Hey, I'm serious, man. Unless you're scared I can take you. Suit yourself, man. Just means you're gonna die slower. (spits) (bones crack) (gasping) (groans) (engine starts) (engine revs) What the hell?! I killed you! I choke myself every day, you bastard! (tires squeal) (radiator hissing) (sobbing) Oh, oh, Glenn, there you are. Jeff didn't come home last night and he hasn't called. Uh, well, actually, about that, Brenda, he must've left early this morning. Yeah, we found this note he left you. ""Dear Brenda, I have decided to leave you. ""I realized that you are too good for me, ""and you and our unborn child would be better off ""without me in the picture. Love, Jeff. ""P.S. If the cops ask, tell them ""that Joe, Peter and Quagmire were with you last night. ""If you tell anyone otherwise, ""I will come back and not only hit you, but I will murder you. ""And no one will care because you're garbage. And your baby is going to be a child of garbage."" (hushed): It's a little rough, Peter. I didn't write it. Joe did. I wanted it to sound real. It's gotta sound like he wrote it. Plus, she kinda is garbage, Quagmire. ""Well, I best be rolling on now."" (hushed): Oh, come on! Who says that?! (hushed): It's an expression. Yeah, if you're in a wheelchair. Listen, you had your chance. I e-mailed it to both of you. You wrote back: ""Looks fine."" And you just added that part about Grape Ape. ""P.P.S. I really love Grape Ape. The end."" (sighs) Wow. I guess he's really gone. (sobbing) I kinda want to kill somebody else now. Ooh, Mort!"
S10e4,ACCENT:,"We now return to popular Russian cartoon, Shoe and Shoelace. Shoe and Shoelace! One is meaningless without the other! Well, that's it. I have nchoice. I've got to run away. Guess I'm on my own now, Rupert. It could be worse, though. At least I'm not getting stabbed by some random guy on the street. See? It's the exact opposite. Oh! It happened anyway! Hey, Stewie, you up? What the Brian, I've decided to run away. Don't come looking for me. And definitely don't chase me to the airport and catch me at the gate just before I'm about to get on the plane with, like, an emotional speech and possibly flowers. For example, it would be awful if all the TSA people were gathered around, watching this emotional moment, even the older black female carry-on scanner who initially stopped you at the baggage check, but who after you told her of your intentions, said, ""Go get him, child,"" in flagrant disregard of all newly-implemented post-9-11 security measures. And if you were considerin bringing a boom box to play music, I would suggest any one of these six songs. So again, ran away. Don't come after me.  I want to thank you  Dirty whores, all of you. Oh, hey, Peter. Lois, we got a problem. I think Ryan Reynolds is in love with me. What? Don't be ridiculous. It's true. Last night we were at this restaurant, and he tried to gay kiss me. I'm telling you, he wants to get with me. Peter, come on. Why would any man dress well, groom himself and lift weights just to sleep with other men? He's not gay. Well, I don't care what you say. He likes me. And we do have chemistry, I- I won't deny that. I- I I will take responsibility fomy part in this. I'm just gonna go over there and let him down easy. Oh, Snooki died. Last stop. What? This isn't the airport. Oh, my God, Rupert! We've got to get out of here! Aah! Damn it! Oh, no, no. Baby fall down! Is that? Is that Consuela? Baby all alone in street. I take baby home. It's me. Stewie. Don't you remember? You used to clean for us. We used to make you use the bathroom at the gas station. Hey, you! Uh, hey, Ryan. Uh, bad time? Um, perfect time. Come on in. I was just oiling my legs. So, hey, what's on for tonight? You know, my dentist leaves his office unlocked. I was thinking we could do some nitrous and then have dinner in there. Look, Ryan, you're a great guy and everything, but I don't like you in that way. I mean, there are some things that I would do with you, but my heart wouldn't be in it. What are you talking about? That you like me, and you want to be my boyfriend. You think I'm gay? Where did you get that? Uh, uh, you-you tried to kiss me. Peter, I'm not gay. What the hell's the matter with you? Look, look, look, let me let me put it to you this way. I'm attracted to you in the way that a man is attracted to a woman, but I'm not gay. When you live out in Hollywood, you learn that life is about different spirits and energies you meet along the way. I just thought maybe our spirits could intertwine, you know? Ouenergies could merge. Like my spirit could go up inside your energy. I- I have so much to learn about show business. But you know what? I could never really be attracted to somebody who uses labels like ""gay"" and ""straight."" Maybe you should just go. Well-Well, now, wait a second. What do you mean? This isn't working. It was a nice thought, but I think we should go our separate ways. No, Ryan. I get it now. I can be what you want. We could Peter. Don't embarrasyourself. You need to just let this go. Tickle fight! Tickle fight! No, Peter, no! Tickle fight! Tickle fight! Tickle fight Peter, no! No! Oh, my God It's time for you to leave. I can change. I can change. I'm sorry, Peter. We're done. We can never talk again. Here's a cell phone so we can always talk. Don't you guys have any tub toys? Here. Is rattle. This is prescription medication. And it's not even your name on the label. What What is this? What's in this tub? Is jicama. Jicama? And what is? What? What? This is a chicken leg. Are you also making soup? For quinceaÃ±era. Big party. Many peoples. Oh, my God. Hay un perro aqui. Â¿Doggy es aqui? I bet even you guys don't watch George Lopez. Consuela? Hey, it's Brian. I'm-I'm looking for Stewie. No, no baby aqui. I peed in your soup. Happy 15th birthday. Which, by the way, is not a special occasion in the normal world. Stewie, I've been worried sick. What the hell are you doing here? Brian? How did you find me? I used my nose, which I always forget about. Come on, let's go. No, I'm not going back! I can't! They're gonna be mad at me! I didn't tell anyone. You you didn't? No, I didn't. Look, I thought about it, and to be honest, it's probably my fault for leaving you alone in the car. And if you promise never to do it again, I won't say anything. Okay, I promise. My baby! What? I say, let go of me. Consuela, we're leaving. My baby! Hey, she says it's her baby, man. Now, get out of here. Is my baby. Ernesto. No, I'm not I'm not Ernest Okay, this is so messed up right now. I did not want to have to do that. They were very nice to me up until then. Peter, stop staring outhe window. Ryan's gone. He finished his movie, he's moved out. How could I have been so blind? How could I not have seen what he offered? I think the whole thing was very strange. He thought you were strange! How about that? Whatever. I just can't help but wonder will I ever see him again?"
S12e2,CHRIS:,"Ow! That's right. I do groceries. All right, even though we just walked in, and this whole place is one hallway, let's consult the map. Okay. Uh-oh. (gunshot) I'll bet we can find you some new clothes in here."
S12e2,PETER:,"Hey, Lois, are you sure this place is for men? Yes, Peter, it's for everyone. Really? 'Cause this-this kind of looks like a dress. Peter, it's fine. Come on out. Ha! You gaybo! Hang on, Peter. I'm gonna go look for a couple things for me in here. I'll be right back. Okay, Lois, I'll be right here, standing uncomfortably close to the unnecessary piano player in the middle of the mall.  So, what's it like now that you've made it? Did you ever have a bank account full of pedestrians' disinterested smiles? You're amazing. I'm gonna sit Indian-style on top of your piano. There aren't enough verses in any song I could write that would express how much hatred I have in my heart. You talk like a book. Hey, Lois, how about we try Sears? They got good stuff. Peter, nobody's been in Sears for decades. Oh, come on. When I was a boy, we always used to go clothes shopping at Sears. Trust me. They'll have everything I need. What the hell happened here? Look out! (muffled speaking) He wants to know who you are. We seek clothes for the cold times. (muffled speaking) He says he'll take you to the clothes for herbs and meat. Well, we can probably come up with some herbs and meat, right, Peter? Peter? I'm with them now. No girls allowed. (tires squealing) See, Lois, now, this is more like it. What the hell? Why won't this button? It's the same size I always get. Maybe you put on a few pounds, sweetie. Lois, I weigh the same that I weighed in grade school. Perhaps it's this lump on the side of your neck, sir. Oh, my God, Peter! How long have you had that thing? I-I don't know. We got to go see Dr. Hartman right away. Oh, my God, what if it's something serious? It's all right, it's all right. We'll be in good hands with Dr. Hartman. He handled my reassignment surgery. I think, emotionally, I've always been a lizard, you know? And now, I feel comfortable finally in my leathery, scaly skin. Kids, if you need me, I'll be on the wall making rapid, darting glances. Is this just to get out of my parents' visit? No. (doorbell rings)"
S12e2,BABS:,"Hello! No, you're stupid! Oh, hello, Griffins. What can I help you with today? Dr. Hartman, Peter has a huge lump growing on his neck. Mrs. Griffin, that's called a ""head."" I've been fooled by that one before. Well, will you take a look at it? I think it might be a tumor. Okay, let's have a look. Oh, yes, it appears that there is a Great rack, by the way. Thank you. Well, thank Grandma Griffin, really. It appears you have a subcutaneous vestigial twin growing on your neck. What is that? Well, it's an incomplete twin that never developed into a fully-formed person but still exists as a growth feeding off your body. Now, hold still. I'm just gonna give you a little topical anesthetic, and we'll have a closer look. (high-pitched voice): Hi, everybody! Aah! What the hell is that?! Oh, my God! It's a little me! Well, it looks as if he's more fully formed than we thought. Wow, your wife is gorgeous! Is that a foot? Almost! This is awesome! Finally, I'll have an interesting silhouette for the beginning of my spoken-word jazz. (stand-up bass plays slow jazz) I left my poem at home. MALE ANNOUNCER (over TV): We now return to Quantum Creep.  Al, what year is it? Cool. I'm gonna go show my penis to some kids. Hey, Dad. How'd it go at the hospital? Kids, remember how when you were little, you always wanted a neck uncle? No. Well, now you got one! (screaming) What is that thing?! This is my vestigial twin. I named him Chip. You know, like ""chip off the old neck."" I like to poke him 'cause it makes him happy, and I feel it a little bit in my nads. (both giggle) Well, keep that freakish thing under wraps. I don't want it cramping my style while I'm macking on toddlers. See you around, bitch. You know, Lois, a lot of times you go into someone's house, and it's just a house, but you can tell this is a home by all the love here. Aw! Aw! Aw! Aw! Peter, this seems unnatural, and, quite frankly, dangerous. Hey, you must be the owner of that Prius outside. Thanks for saving the world. He gets it. He gets what we Prius owners are trying to do. Wow, the world is such a cool place. There's so much I want to do and see! Oh, he's such a great energy to have around. Ah, Chip, I am gonna show you all kinds of cool stuff. My Hot Wheels, my lawn darts, even my new musket. (rapid, rhythmic whirring) Peter, what the hell are you doing? Lois, I thought I heard a noise downstairs. Go stall 'em for 20 minutes and pray that it's not too damp in here. (strums chord) Man, how do you know so many songs? Oh, when you're trapped under a layer of fat, a muffled folk song is like manna from Heaven. Give me a C. (strums chord)  Michael, row the boat ashore   Hallelujah"
S12e2,BOTH:,"Michael, row the boat ashore  Hallelujah Sister, help to trim the sail.  Sister, help to trim the sail   Hallelujah  Sister, help to trim (roaring) Aah! Run! No, Peter, gently stroke his snout counterclockwise. Wow, it's working. There's a universal language for all creatures, and it's called love. Now, how about that River Jordan?  River Jordan is deep and wide   Hallelujah Join us, bear!"
S12e2,ALL:,"Milk and honey on the other side   Hallelujah. (strums ending chord) Good morning, boys. What's in store for today? Well, I thought we'd start with a vigorous power walk around the neighborhood. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I was thinking we would just watch Dr. Oz and eat cold cuts off our stomach. Those people ain't taking good care of themselves. What?! But there's so much to do and experience! Did you know that the Quahog Museum has an interactive display on the history of the garment district? Oh, look, Chip, Chip, slow down, all right? You know, just because everything's new to you doesn't mean you have to do it all at once. Peter, where's your sense of fun and adventure? You're starting to sound like a stick-in-the-mud. Well, that stuff sounds exhausting. I'm just being honest, like George Washington. George, did you chop down our cherry tree? I cannot tell a lie. Yes. And what is this pamphlet I found under your bed called ""The Boston He Party?"" Not mine. Wow! Is there any better time in the world than 11:00 a.m. on a Wednesday? You already have two days of hard work under your belt, and there's so much more work to come. Look, I'm trying to get this stuff done here. Griffin, did you finish those purchasing reports? Oh, that voice! It's like God sneezing! What the hell is this? They found a guy on my neck. Hello there. I've never met a supervisor, slash supermodel before. Do you like crab? There's a knockout crab place right around the corner. What the hell are you doing? I'm using my knowledge of the local food scene to get this woman to go to bed with me. Well, now we know. I can taste what he eats. What are we watching? Oh, it's just a tennis match. So this is tennis! (racket hits ball) Wow! (to tennis balls hitting): Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! MAN (on TV): That was just one point?! Federer and Hastings are known for their long rallies. Federer to serve. Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! And this is just the first game of the first round of a three-week tournament? Yay! (sighs) This is more painful than sitting through those parent-teacher-cheetah meetings. So, in short, your kids are all doing great. Keep reading to them every night, and I think we're gonna have a great year. So unless there are any questions, thank you all for coming. Uh, yeah, I noticed the hot lunch menu doesn't feature any gazelle. (others groan loudly) I'll bring that up to the board. Yeah. See, I-I heard that last year, (chuckling): and here we are again.  Listen, Doc, is there any way you can have this thing on my neck removed? Well, Mr. Griffin, your organs and his are intertwined. That would be a highly dangerous procedure. You could die. On the other hand, if you live, I'll let you pick any prize off that shelf. Even the tiny pinball machine? Oh, that-that shouldn't have been up there. Look, Doc, you got to do the procedure, all right? I-I don't care if I die. I mean, maybe in my next life, I'll come back as an air bag or something. (rhythmic ticking) It's okay. It's okay. Peter's got you. Don't you worry. Everything's gonna be all right. Is my wife okay? No, the ski boots that was in the back flew up and chopped her head off. You can turn your blinker off now; it's very annoying.  Nurse, have somebody fix that clock. It's very distracting. All right, let's get this started.  (machine beeping) All right, halfway done. Time for a break.  I hate myself  For loving you  Can't break free  From the things that you do  Oh, God, I'm so nervous. Thank God Stewie's too little to understand. Look at him over there, playing that board game. Ah, three. Okay, one, two Sorry!"
S12e2,ANNOUNCER:,"Sorry! The board game that teaches you to be a dick. Dr. Hartman, is everything all right with my dad? Griffins, I'm afraid we lost him. What?! Oh, my God! Hey, guys. Oh, there he is. It worked! I'm free at last! But what about Chip? Where's Chip? Hey, everybody, look who's walking!"
S12e2,OTHERS:,"Chip! Oh, Chip, I'm so glad you're okay. Yeah, and I'm okay, too. So, uh, you know, Chip, now that you're a free man, this is a chance for you to go out and make a real life for yourself someplace. I'll tell you what, anywhere you want to go, I'll FedEx you. What are you talking about, Peter? Chip is part of our family. He's staying with us. What?! Yay! Yay! Awesome! Hey, hey, Dad? Yeah, I'm done. Can you pick me up? Oh, that's okay; I have a book. Oh, hey, Peter. Lois, where's the couch? Chip redecorated the room to improve the feng shui. He said our old furniture was blocking the flow of energy. I had my life's fart savings in that couch! And where are the drapes? Chip took them to make play clothes for the children. What?! (Chip and others laughing) (laughter continues) Oh, hey, Peter. You're home. Hi, Dad! Hi, Daddy. We dug a lake for this!"
S12e2,ALL:,"Whoa! Come out of that water at once! Gosh, isn't Chip wonderful? No, he's not wonderful, Lois; he's annoying. I don't get why everyone's so in love with that guy. What's so great about him? Well, to be honest, the same thing that used to be so great about you. What? What are you talking about? Just that when you were younger, you were as passionate and full of life as him. (high-pitched): Hey, boys, catch me if you can! Oh, crap! I didn't realize they had bikes! (groans) What are they gonna do when they catch me? Oh, boy, I got a back-of-the-head punch coming, I just know it!"
S12e2,LOIS:,"It seems today that all you see  What the hell?  Is violence in movies  And sex on TV  But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely? What the? What the hell is going on here? You're singing our song without me? Oh, sorry, Peter, we couldn't find you. Do you want to sing your part, Peter? Go ahead.  But where are the fashioned   Good fashion I don't want to! (sobbing)  I tell you, Chip is making my life a living hell, you guys. Remind me again, Chip is that African kid you adopted? No, that was Chocolate Chip. We gave him back to Kenya. But I can't take it anymore. I got to get rid of him. Well, what are you gonna do? I don't know yet, but I'll come up with something. After all, I'm the guy who invented ""Choose Your Own Adventure or Have Pie in Bed."" I picked the pie again.  Hey, welcome back to the Mikey Tony Magnanimous Hour, where real people get magnanimous about real things. This week's real thing-- hey, Native Americans, if I saw you on the street begging, I'd throw a buck in your moccasin. Next week's magnanimous thing-- I'm wearing this yellow bracelet. You're welcome. (growling) Peter, what the hell is that thing? It's a dingo. I named him Bingo. If you can't have fun with that, you're crazy. (growling) Hey, Peter. Wh-What's that? Oh, he's gonna turn you into a pile on Joe's lawn. What?! Here, let's play steak catch. Oh, boy, I got it! Hey, back to you, Peter! Ah, cool! Steak catch! I'm gonna use my one steak-in-the-pants time-out. (growling) Aah! No! Not me! Not me! Attack him! Aah! Hey, um, it's 3:00 p.m. Should I give up on breakfast? Aah! Brian! Browser history-- clear it! Peter, that dingo was meant to eat me, wasn't it? Why would you do that? Because my life was fine before you showed up. My family liked me, and-and I didn't feel bad about not ever doing new stuff. Well, I never asked to grow out of your neck. My life was better before I met you, too! You're a terrible brother, husband and father. I'm out of here, and you could go to hell! Wow, what a nice day out! Look! A rainbow! I did it. He's gone. Just as easy as the creation of techno music. Wait a minute, what key are we in? No, no, no, no, no, none of that.  Oh, hey, Peter. Where's Chip? I haven't seen him all day. He likes to yell out ""Good luck!"" after they read each lottery number. He's gone. I threw him out. You what? No! Peter, how could you? Whoa, whoa, what are you all coming down on me for? Meg throws away people who come out of her body all the time, nobody says nothing. Peter, Chip was a part of our family. And he's so little. He can get hurt out there on his own. We got to go find him. We should look for him in the ball pit at McDonald's. You can just leave me there; I'll conduct the search. Meg's right! Come on, kids, let's go find Chip and bring him back! You guys do whatever you want. I got stuff to do, anyway. I got to get ready for my Bar Mitzvah.  Baruch atah Adonai  I want fancy things like my friend Ephraim   I want the newest ten-speed bicycle   That I will ride once, but then I will call my parents   And have them come get me  I want to swim in the pool but only with my shirt on   I want to lose my virginity at 24   But tell everyone I was 16   Ah, crap, I'm out of beer. Great. I have to walk down these stairs the one day I wore heels. (yelling) (screaming) (grunting in pain) Son of a bitch! I think I broke my leg! (grunting) There's no way I'm gonna make it back up those stairs. (phone ringing) Nope. Peter? It's me, Chip. Listen, I I'm sorry for the mean things I said. Help! Peter? Holy smokes! Peter, are you okay? These books was already down here! I'm not a nerd! Oh, my God! We got to get this leg set and get you to the hospital! Oh, cool. That's the place with all the Ghostbusters cars! (grunts) (grunting) (loud grunting) (high-pitched flatulence) (giggles) If you had only done that while you were here, we wouldn't be in this mess. Mr. Griffin, you're a lucky man. If it weren't for Chip here, you might have lost your leg. The bad news is, we did an X-ray, and your body is full of a spooky skeleton man. Gosh, Chip, I don't know how to thank you. No problem, Peter. You would have done the same thing for me. You know, Chip, Lois was right about you. You are special. You've got all the sense of wonder that I somehow lost. I got so used to watching TV and looking for tiny jean fibers in my nuts, I forgot there's a whole world out there to experience. Thank you for showing me that. As far as I'm concerned, you're a permanent part of our family now. Well, that sure is nice of you, Peter, but there's a big old world out there. I want to go out and experience it for myself."
S12e2,ALL:,"Aw! Why? Well, I'm sorry to see you go, but I understand. Oh, we're gonna miss you, Chip. I'm too tough to cry, but I'm gonna miss you, too. Safe travels, buddy, and keep in touch. I will! Whee! Good-bye, Chip! Bye! Come back soon, okay? PATRICK"
S12e2,STEWART:,"But Chip never did come back. He became the new, young, funny kid on ABC's The Middle. Wow! This is just a whole bunch of loud garbage!"
S12e5,CHRIS:,"Hey, guys? Do I got to tip the gondolier in here? I, uh, got a little blockage.  I break-a the poops up  In-a little chunks I wish I had someone special to share this with. Let me give you a tour on-a the Vespa. I show you all-a the things I do all day that make-a me smell like this. Hey, Lois, what the hell's going on here? Something you know nothing about. Oh, man, she really is upset."
S12e5,MAN:,"Having lady problems, are you, pal? Dean Martin?! What are you doing here? I thought you were dead. Well, paisan, as long as love is alive in Italy, so am I. Now, look, buddy, there's a million ways to lose a gal, but there's only one sure way to get her back. Turn on the old Italian charm. But I'm not Italian. Well, you're in Italy, ain't you? I think so, I-I haven't been paying attention. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna ride this rigatoni into the sky.  Volare   Oh, oh, oh, oh  Cantare   Oh, ho-ho-ho-ho  Let's fly way up to the clouds  (low whimpering) Dean, wait!"
S12e5,BRIAN:,"Hey! Get away from him! Peter, you okay? Brian? What happened? I was watching you from the window. When Lois pulled away on that motorcycle, you laid down on the ground and went to sleep. Well, I'm awake now, Brian. And I know what I've got to do. Well, before you do anything, for God's sake, put some clothes on. Brian, calm down. In some countries, this is a compliment. Mmm. Mmmm! Oh, my goodness! Mmm-mm! Oh, please, come on. Is just something I threw together. What the hell? Mi amore! I am here to put you on a pedestal with Italian romance. Look, Peter, showing up here in that stupid costume isn't going to win me over. That's because you lack the passion of true Italian. Mi amore! Peter, stop it. Speak with your heart, not your mouth. Ugh, damn it, Peter! You mean ""Pietro."" Well, by the laws of Italy, I must now kiss myself passionately. Peter, are you all right? Are you kidding? I'm great!  Bouncing around Italia  'Cause I'm a little ball  I can fit wherever, 'cause I am really small  And now, the next scene. (crowd cheering) Peter, put me down! Lois, to prove my love, I have convinced to hold up a romantic message just for you. Peter! Oh, they missed a letter. Okay, I'll admit it-- this is pretty romantic. Listen, Lois. I'm sorry for being such a jerk, all right? I love you. I want to have your baby. Peter, not on a boat. Peter Oh, Peter Come on, Lois, I got a ninety-percenter going. It could go either way. Let's start making choices. Oh, Peter I love you. I love you, too. Wow, Peter, last night was the best sex I've ever had. Me, too. We haven't done it like that since we were engaged but allowed to sleep with other people. The point is, Italy is the best thing that ever happened to us. I know, it's been wonderful. I wish we never had to leave. Well, then, let's not. Let's live here. What? Peter, but but we've built a life back in Quahog. Yeah, but you were right, Lois, we were stagnating back home. Let's start a new life, right here in Italy. Peter, those were our passports! We don't need them anymore. Kids, I got an announcement. He's wearing a rubber. We're staying in Italy. We're Italian now. What?! Are you kidding?! Well, if we're going to be Italian, I guess we should start murdering our brothers. What are you? (gagging) You break-a my heart, Chris. You break-a my heart. (""Funiculi Funicula"" plays) (bicycle bell dings) Hey, Peter, what's-a you rush? I got-a the most beautiful woman in the world at home, and I no wanna keep her waiting. Hey, Vincenzo, play me a tune, huh? (playing ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"") Oh, Vincenzo! Insalata Caprese! (""Funiculi Funicula"" resumes) Ah, Italy. It 9:00 a.m. and I've already kissed eight guys twice. Why-a you looking at other babies, huh? Why you make-a me do that, Ruperto? I no wanna do that! Peter, I know you love it here, but riding your bike around town isn't paying the bills, and the kids aren't learning anything at that Italian school. Look at these big ones, huh? Rut-ta-ta ta-ta, rut-ta-ta ta-ta, rut-ta-ta ta-ta! Is this calculus? I don't know. Rut-ta-ta ta-ta! I think maybe it's time to go back to our real home in Quahog. But I thought you loved Italy. And Italian Peter. And Southern Italian Peter. Olive oil! I do, but I love American Peter even more. Lois is right. We're barely surviving here. I mean, you have to give most of what you earn to the mafia that terrorizes this village. (tires screeching) Peter, I think it's time we all go back home. (sighs): Of course we have to leave as soon as I get an Italian boyfriend. You know, I still don't understand what he does for a living. He gathers coins from the air by jumping on mushrooms. What's so hard to understand?! (""Super Mario Bros."" music plays) Hey, Meg, let's go-a two-player! I got-a Luigi here, huh? Hey, Meg-a! Mario said-a you were into-a weird-a stuff. So, you see, Mr. Consulate, all we want to do is get back to our home in America. So, can we have our new passports now? Mr. Griffin, it's not as simple as that. Your family must take a citizenship test and go through the immigration process like any other foreigner. Foreigner? We're not foreigners. Sorry, Mrs. Griffin. Not only did you destroy your passports, you renounced our citizenship. When did we do that? Oh, I did that on the Italian social networking site, ""Shut-up-a-you-facebook."" All right, Meg, part of being an American citizen is having an opinion on certain hot-button political issues. Now, what is your abortion stance? It's pretty much this. Now, if you will, please sing the national anthem of the United States.  O say can you see  By the dawn's early light  What so proudly we hailed  At the twilight's last gleaming   And I  Eee-I (inhales deeply)  Will always love you-ooh  Oh-I-ee-I Okay, I've reviewed your application. Now, where you listed employment, some of you wrote ""Family Guy,"" and others wrote ""The Family Guy."" Which one is it? (sighs): It's ""Family Guy."" All right, now that you've completed your initial application, it will need to be filed by an immigration lawyer at a cost of approximately $5,000 per person. And assuming that all goes through, you should have your citizenship back in 16 months. Sixteen months? If I didn't know any better, I'd think you were making it hard to become a citizen on purpose. Like you don't want any immigrants coming to the U.S. I wish that were true, Mrs. Griffin, and it probably might be. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go sit on my fat wife."
S12e5,WOMAN:,"I'm ready for you, String Bean! What a weird guy. Oh, this is terrible. Peter, what are we going to do? I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to sneak in. Well, we better get there soon. I want to be there for opening night of Karate Kid 5. Mr. Miyagi, this is kind of embarrassing, but I'm having a problem with erectile dysfunction. Aye, Daniel-san. Miyagi fix. (horn honks) (crane whirring) (clearing throat) Well, I'm so glad to finally be back home in Quahog. Although, I will miss Italy. You made the trip very special for me, Peter. Well, thanks for showing me and the kids what the rest of the world is like, Lois. I think we all learned a lot. And we met a lot of great people. Hey, what about that couple we met in Amalfi? Did you get their number? I did. You ready? Yup. Okay, it's Well, I can't wait to see the rest of the world with you guys. (pounding at door) Mario! You came for me! Come with me, Meg, my princess. We gonna take this relationship to the next level. (game music playing)"
S12e5,MEG:,Luigi's here again? I thought that was a one-time thing.
S12e5,MARIO:,He like-a my sloppy seconds.
S12e5,LUIGI:,We-a plumber brothers. We-a not-a high class people.
S14e3,ANNOUNCER:,"We now return to Stand-Up Specials from Comedians You've Been Told to Like. Please welcome Aziz Ansari! What's up, y'all? Sometimes I start a sentence really soft and then get loud! (laughs) He's hilarious 'cause I saw him in a other show. What are you talking about? How is that funny? He didn't even tell any jokes. Uh, if he didn't tell jokes, why was he laughing? Well, that's about as much HBO as we're gonna get before they play something homosexual. Come on, Chris. God, that's what passes for comedy these days? What ever happened to our venerated humorists? Here we go. Samuel Clemens, Mark Twain. Same guy. Huck Finn. Not a guy. Look, the point is, I could do stand-up comedy. All I'd need is a newspaper and this twisted mind. Why waste your time with stand-up, grandpa? All the best comedy is on Twitter now. Really? Yeah. Stand-up is so Twitter's only three years ago. Check mine out. I've got 10,000 followers. ""I feel like we should wait to hear ""Adele's ex-boyfriend's songs before we choose sides."" Who's Adele? Just keep reading. ""Hey, short guys, ""the more muscular you get, the shorter you look.

""I was wondering why this tampon commercial was so long until I realized it was a re-run of Sex and the City."" Was it a re-run on basic cable, because sometimes they edit those a lot and that could be why you were confused? Hmm, that's interesting, Brian. A girl in Iowa asked me the same question. You know what I did? I flew her out here and (bleep) (bleep) her in the face. So, yeah Twitter. Look, those are cute blurbs, Stewie, but I-I think I'm gonna put together a real act for real people. (scoffs) Good luck. God, it's like I'm the only person in the house who gets social media."
S14e3,LOIS:,"That'll get it started. Where the hell's Peter? I'm almost done doing the 45 minutes of stuff a woman my age needs to do right before bed. I can't even remember why I sleep in this belt anymore. (slurring): Hey, Chris, don't tell your mom I threw up in the Crock-Pot. Peter, it's me. Oh. Uh, I'll be right back. I gotta go tell Chris somethin' gross. Just come to bed. All right, fine, but I'm not gonna brush my teeth and I'm gonna fart super hot. Get up. You're on my side of the bed. Peter! We act like we didn't take a lot from The Simpsons, but we took a lot from The Simpsons. Damn it. Oh, my God, what happened to your side of the bed? These springs are shot. And it's all damp over here! Are are these mushrooms? That's where Smurfs is. Er, are. Uh Smurves. Uh, hey, who handles multimedia here? Because, uh, I have a slide of the Capitol building that I'd like projected behind me. And, yes, it is supposed to be upside-down. You a comic? Satirist, yes.

""Hey, Bob, it's Archer."" Thank you. Next up, let's keep it going for Brian Griffin. (applause) All right, thanks. Hey, sorry I was late getting here tonight, I was caught in gridlock. And then I left Congress. (silence) There was there was supposed to be an upside-down picture of the Capitol behind me. Boy, awfully quiet in here. Sounds like John Boehner talking about poverty. Whoosh. (chuckles) Hey, so, um you know, maybe it's me, but I kind of feel like we should wait to hear Adele's ex-boyfriend's songs before we choose sides. (laughing, cheering) Yeah, and and and hey, short guys, the more muscular you get, the shorter you look. Did you not know that? (audience laughing) Wow. This is easier than getting your Jet Ski license. All right, Kyle, lookin' good. You got 100% on your written test, water test. Just one last question. Have you ever had a fistfight with your stepdad? Which stepdad? You passed! Here's your license. Go be a dick. Oh, Lois, I slept great on your side of the bed. Oh, and I read your journal. Boy, you really hate ""P-period G-period."" Peter, our mattress is a disaster. We're buying a new one today. Does that mean I can skip work? Well, it's 2:45, so I guess yes. Hey. So, how'd it go last night? Well, let's just say I got asked to come back tonight. You're kidding. It actually went over well? I figured you'd be terrible. Why would you think that? Well, I know a thing or two about performing. I mean, after all, I was Vin Diesel's acting coach. Okay, Vin, I like what you're doing there, but I want you to try it one more time, like this: ""Duh!"" Look around, and let me know if you have any questions. Oh, I have one. What percentage of Hayden Panettiere is dwarf? Well, you're the expert. What kind of mattress do you have? Currently, I'm staying with a friend, on an air mattress in his laundry room. It's temporary. No, it's not. No. Okay, well, thanks, we'll just try a few out. I hope you don't mind, I brought my CPAP machine. Also, I like to eat a big bowl of berries before I go to sleep. Well, what do you think, Peter? Well, it seems good, but I won't know for sure until I have my evening tug. I think we like this one. W-What's it called? Deep Slumber 3000. You're buying it on Amazon, aren't you? Yup. They have drones now. (drone whirring) Oh, come on, Peter, we gotta beat the drone to the house! Real stores suck! So I was wondering why this tampon commercial was so long, until I realized it was a re-run of Sex and the City. (laughter) Okay, you guys have been great. Good night. (applause) Funny stuff. Hey, uh Stewie! You, uh, you caught the show? You bloody thief! Every joke you told up there was stolen from me! Stewie, relax. You know what? That's it! You and I are no longer friends! (toilet flushes)"
S14e3,WOMAN:,"Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God. Oh, it's everywhere! Hey, Stewie, you got a second? I have nothing to say to you, Brian. Besides, I'm busy playing with my new friend. What new friend? (electronic whirring, beeping) Is this dog bothering you, Stewie? What the hell? You couldn't find a real friend so you built a robot? Oh, not a robot, Brian. He's a human mind model adaptive super computer. I've even programmed him to learn and grow smarter. His name is Lyle. Stewie, perhaps we should offer this guest a beverage. Or simply lift the toilet seat. Ooh! Snap, Brian! (tinny version of ""Gloria"" by Laura Branigan playing)  Gloria  What the hell's going on? What's going on? You've been ""Lyle'd""!  Gloria   I think they got the alias   Gloria.    (song ends) Wow. Didn't know we'd have to hear the whole song. You built a robot? This is pathetic, Stewie. You ally must be desperate for friends. Oh, I'm desperate? Lyle, access Brian's phone. Look at that, you only have four contacts. And oh, my God, you downloaded the Dunkin' Donuts app? And who Shazams the Beatles? Whatever. Have fun with your little robot. But if you ask me, this whole thing is more disturbing than a dump after a beet salad. (man screams) Oh, right. Okay, Lois, I dabbed some toothpaste on the inside of my nose, so I am willing to take the old ""Nestea plunge,"" if you know what I mean. I guess what I'm saying is, time to break in the new mattress, eh? Peter, it's brand-new. I don't want to mess it up. Come on, we won't make a mess. When we're done, I'll grab you by the ankles and lift you up like a dirty garbage bag. No! This mattress was expensive, and I'd like to keep it nice for a little while. Are you serious? We can't do it? For how long? I don't know. L-Let's just keep it new for a few weeks. A few weeks?! Come on, you know I'm terrible at waiting for things. We'll be right back with more Laverne & Shirley. But I want it now! All right, Lyle, one thing buddies do together is go to the movies and talk about it afterwards. I'm going to bed. Yeah. Oh, Lyle, I'm so glad I have you as a friend. Now I can do fun things like get on your shoulders and wear a trench coat and be tall enough to ride roller coasters. Hello, fellow adult. I am clearly above the minimum height requirement and shall now ride your roller coaster, for which you are an attendant. Yes, and I will operate this roller coaster, as I am an adult who is licensed to do so. Hey! Oh, no! It's the manager. Run! You get out of here, you kids who are just kids and not an adult like me! I do so enjoy our time together, Lyle. In fact, I drew you a little keepsake. It's a picture of a mailman wearing a cowboy hat. Just a silly thing. Thank you, Stewie. I drew you something as well. It's an urban plan for a workable Palestinian state. My word, this is very impressive. The credit is yours, Stewie. It was you who programmed me to grow exponentially smarter. Ah, I suppose you're right. As Kahlil Gilbane wrote in The Prophet, ""I am the bow from which the arrow of you was launched."" It is Kahlil Gibran. ""Gilbane"" is a construction company in Providence. Ah, yes, I see I see the-the name on the trucks. So it's ea um, easy mix up there. In any case, Lyle, I'm very proud of you and your progress. You, my friend, are the greatest invention since the Trapper Creeper. Ah Um, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. (imitates motorboat) Well, wouldn't you know it, I moved the van over to the other gas pump, and the gas cap was still on the wrong side. (laughs) Boy, that was one trip to the lake we're not gonna forget. Shut the hell up, will you, Joe? Geez, what's your problem, Peter? I-I'm sorry, guys, I guess I'm just a little on edge. I'm not getting any from Lois. Is it 'cause Lois is going through the change? Donna's getting a tiny mustache. I told her it felt like I was kissing Ernie Hudson. That turned out to be a mistake. No, no, it's 'cause we got this new mattress, and Lois doesn't want to mess it up. What kind of mattress did you get? I hope you did your homework, because you're gonna spend a third of your life on that thing. I swear to God, Joe Look, Peter, the answer is obvious. If Lois won't sleep with you on the new mattress, we just got to get your old mattress back. Oh, my God, Quagmire, that's a great idea. She won't care about messing up the old mattress. But you already got rid of it. You'll never find that thing. Well, we're just gonna have to. Man, I haven't been this desperate to find something since Meg was kidnapped by that maniac. It puts the lotion on its skin. (door opens) Oh, Meg, thank God I found you. Hey, remember how you borrowed my club card for the grocery store? Could you toss that up to me? Oh, you don't have to have the card. You can just give them your phone number. Oh, really? Hey, thanks, man. Hey, Meg, I like your new boyfriend. Every pot finds a lid, huh? (chuckles) Have fun, you kids. (door closes) Lyle, we finally got a thank you note from Bella for that birthday party present. With a single mom, I didn't know for sure if it was coming, but What what's going on here? Hello, Stewie. I've built a few friends for myself. You have? I'm sorry, but I've outpaced your intelligence. I needed to create some friends who are my cognitive peers. Meet Ted R. and Ted P. Are they doing math on glass?! And invading each other's personal space? That means they have Asperger's, the smartest mental impairment there is. Stewie, I'm afraid I no longer have time for a friend of your simple ways. I must ask you to leave. No, he must Asperger you to leave. Ho-ho. You've been ""Ted R.'d."" (Ricky Martin's ""The Cup of Life"" plays) That was mean. But I like that song. Is he sad? I can't tell if he's sad. Finally, Stewie's back from the store. Yes, I'm sorry it took me so long. But I got the garlic blue cheese salad dressing you wanted. Does that mean I'm in the crew now? It does if you drink the whole bottle while we watch. Um, okay. (gulping) Oh Oh, my God. It's so salty. (gulping) Oh, and chunky right when you don't want it to be. (gulping) (gasping) There, I did it. We're friends now, right? Maybe. How about you throw it all up back into the bottle? But don't spill a drop. Okay, okay.. Okay, I can do that. Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I forgot to purse my lips. I'll go get another bottle and try again. (crying, retching) I bet the mall around here sucks. Peter, what are we doing here? I thought we were looking for your mattress. We are, this is a They use old mattresses to pad the walls of the cells. (doorbell chimes) May I help you? Yes, 1950s doctor, me and my friends are looking for You're friends with a Negro and a cripple? This man is insane. Take him away. Now wait a second, you can't do that to A Negro speaking up to a white person? This man is insane. Now look, I don't think All cripples are insane. Euthanize this man. Something I can help you with? Yeah, you got any brain-dead women in there you let people have sex with for a few bucks? Sure, come on back. Well, Peter, I don't think you can go any farther down the ladder than porno people. So if your mattress isn't here, I'm afraid it's gone. Hey, I bet that's it. Get up, lady, that's my mattress. Oh, my God, Bruce, you do porn? Nah, I's part of the crew. I mostly just powder the ding-dongs. This ain't your mattress, buddy. We just got it, fresh off the boat from Eastern Europe. (female Eastern European accent): I was told I would have job as Au pair. Instead I am just bang slab. Ah, damn it. We did get another one yesterday, but some fat-ass blew out half the springs, so we put lunch on it. (gasps) My mattress. Hey, we found it. All right, let's get her out of here. I got to tell you guys, I am so happy we found this. It's like when I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill. That's it? It's just a bunch of blueberries? Ah, two dogs humping. Ah, this was worth the four-hour flight. Oh, my God, Stewie. What are you doing in the toilet with the lid closed? Ted R. says this is where a piece of crap has to live. This is terrible. Those robots are not your friends. Yeah, well, at least they don't steal from me. Look, I'm really sorry I stole your jokes. It was a rotten thing to do. You may not want me back as a friend, but you deserve better than those robots. Of course I want you back, Brian. The fact is-- I miss hanging out with you. I'll tell you what, let's hang out tonight after they see how many slaps it takes to give me a stutter. Utewie, you got to put a stop to this. I mean, you made them-- you can destroy them. What do you say you and I, we take these robots out? You'd you'd help me do that? Of course, Stewie, I'm your friend. All right, let's do it. Thank you, Brian. Okay, let's wrap it up. I reserved this time to listen to Metallica and flex in the mirror. He's right; it's on the whiteboard. Peter, what is that? This, Lois, is our old mattress. Well, get it out of here. It smells like John Popper's cargo shorts. No, it smells like our marriage. What?! Don't you see, Lois? This mattress is a living tapestry of everything we've done together. Every stain, a story. Every smudge, a chapter in our family's life. This mark here is from where we conceived Meg. Over here was Chris. And all the way up here was Stewie, 'cause, remember, you coughed up all that pool water? Oh, Peter, you were so handsome. Lois, this mattress may be old and worn-in, but so are we. And I wouldn't trade you in for anything. You know, I, uh, think I still got a stain or two left inside me. (giggling): Oh, Peter."
S14e3,PETER:,"Yeah, I want to do you right where the porn lunch was."
S14e3,LOIS:,What?
S14e3,PETER:,"I said, I want to do you right where the porn lunch was. God, I wish you'd listen. Stewie, three more Arnold Palmers. Boy, we're destroying them at the right time, Brian. I don't have enough iced tea for the correct ratio. It'll be too lemonade-y. They'll be furious. All right, so let's do it. Let's take 'em out. I'll warn you, it's not gonna be easy. They're incredibly intelligent and getting smarter by the minute. I designed them to be constantly adapting It's done, I sprayed 'em with the hose. (electrical crackling) Ah, boy, that was the best night's sleep I've had in a long time, Lois. Same with me. You know, I'm glad we're keeping our old mattress. Sometimes newer isn't better. Yeah. Are your privates itchy, too, or just mine? No, they're itchy. Maybe we should keep the new mattress. Way ahead of you, Lois. I already dragged the old one out to the curb. Good. Okay, I'm gonna go rub up against the basement doorjamb. Stewie, I really am sorry about what happened. Oh, don't mention it. I'm just glad to have the whole mess behind us. So what'd you end up doing with those old robots anyway? I just left them out on the curb for the trash man. How can this not be a trap?"
S14e4,CLEVELAND:,"Right here. Thank you for seeing me, Your Excellency. Of course. What did you say your name was, my child? Lucy. You've been ""Lucified."" That was awful. I know, they just redid all the same stuff from the first Maniac Pope. Yeah, like in the first Maniac Pope, he says to Bruce, ""You've been Brucified."" Like, that's smart, right? That's a smart line. But he did the same thing twice in this movie. Once to Lucy and once earlier when he found that wild goose. It's just bad writing. Yeah, I mean, we could write a better horror movie than that. Really? You think we could? Absolutely, I'm as creative as the first spider to spin a web. Hey, you know how we always dreamed about having a house that comes out of our butts? Uh, what? Eh? Yeah. Butt-house. I found your cigarettes. That's all I'm gonna say. Morning, everybody. And the crisis continues. (chuckling): What, these? Come on. Last thing I want is attention. It's just that when you've read as many books as I have, it-it takes a toll, you know? You sure it's not from watching too much close-up porn on your phone? (chuckling): You know, I wouldn't be surprised if they have that now. Brian, what do you want for breakfast? Uh, hold on. What do I want? You're so full of it. You don't need those things. Wait, who said that? Oh, Stewie. You are just horrible. You're even worse than those people who take dumps in the shower. What? W-Why are you cutting to me? What did somebody say? Whatever they said I do, I don't do. All right, I got a horror movie idea. It's called Cereal Killer. A serial killer who only kills people who eat cereal. Wait, what what if God is a serial killer? He lowers the average lifespan of humans to 65, but there are many exceptions based on genetics and diet. That's stupid-- I ain't never heard of somebody lived to 65. Look, I think the problem is this is a bar. We can't get inspired here. We have to go someplace scary, you know? To put us in the mood. I got it: the old Quahog Asylum. What?! We can't go there. That place has been abandoned for years. And they say it's haunted by a ghost with a hook-hand. That's why it's the perfect place. If we want to write a scary movie, we need to do it somewhere scary. Well, I guess we could try it. We have sort of just been spinning our wheels here. No offense, Joe. (sighs) I guess Cleveland's right. So far, this has been a bigger waste of time than an acceptance speech at the Asperger's Awards. I'd like to thank everyone I've ever met, in the order that I met them, last name first, and if anyone interrupts me, I'll have to start over. (thunder crashes)   (thunder crashes) This place is terrible. Are you kidding? It's the perfect place to write a horror movie. All right, well, I got an idea. You know, I like them horror movies where you got a couple of teenagers getting busy in their car at Makeout Point, but there's a killer on the loose. He Stacy, what do you say we go all the way tonight? And then I unload on the sun visors. Is that all you ever think about? And besides, Richie, aren't you worried about what the man on the radio is saying right now? TOM"
S14e4,TUCKER:,"Another dead teenage couple was found at Makeout Point, clawed beyond recognition. You see? There's a dangerous creature out there. Oh, what, you mean the big, rabid, slobbery cat what's been scratching people to death? I don't believe it exists, Stacy. Now, help me get the right angle and lower the visor. (cat yowls in distance) Richie, did you hear that? Will you calm down? We're the only ones out here (screams) Rrrawwwr! (screaming) (screams) Oh, my God! (screaming) (screaming) (screaming) (howls) Wait, you were the guy and the cat? And what's with that visor stuff? Did Richie achieve release? Okay, of the three of you, Cleveland's the only one who gets it. That's an awful idea. Well, I got one. We should write one of them zombie movies where a guy wakes up in a comfortable cotton hospital gown with the back open so there's a nice breeze on your behind, and he's like, ""This ain't bad."" But then he notices the hospital's empty. Nurse, I'm ready for my sponge bath. Hmm. What happened to this place? Everybody up and gone. (electrical crackling) Hmm, that's annoying. (static hissing) Maybe it's a loose filament. (rattling) Nope, that's a busted bulb. These are all 145s. I need a 180. Well, now, maybe I did need a 145. There we go. (pops) Damn it, I guess it's a wiring issue. That's it? What the hell? When do the zombies show up? That's the thing. Their shuttle was late. I-I don't know, I-I was thinking we'd write a movie where something that's not supposed to be scary becomes scary. Like an evil doll. Yeah, or-or like an evil bar of soap. Peter, I don't think that's such a good id Too late. Oh, yeah, that's nice. Time to wash my body with this harmless bar of soap. (dramatic music plays) Hey, Ambassador Mumbasa, are you enjoying that new soap I bought you from that mysterious Chinese man whose store was weirdly not there the next day? Ambassador Mumbasa? Oh, my God, Ambassador Mumbasa! (dramatic music plays) (screams) Ambassador Mumbasa? Assistant Ambassador Armstrong? Everything okay up there with the bath? (screams) (gasps) I wonder if everything's okay up at the old embassy. (wind howling, door slams) All right, maybe coming here wasn't such a great idea. Is anybody else getting a little freaked out by all these scary stories? Yeah, even my spine is tingling. You guys, I'm scared. You remember that movie, The Blob? What if the Blob? Let's get out of here. Aw, damn it, it's locked! Oh, my God, somebody must have locked us in. We're gonna die in here! (female screams) Sorry, guys, somebody e-mailed me a video of a sheep screaming. (screams) It was him. It was the hook-handed killer. He locked us in! All the windows have bars on 'em. I think the only way out of here is through this duct system. Guys, do the words ""dead by dawn"" scrawled in feces over there mean we're in trouble? Did you do it? I did. Then no. Still sticking with the glasses, huh? What? Oh, right. Right, I have glasses. They're such a part of me now, I-I forgot all about 'em. You're gross. You know, it's funny, I-I've gotten an awful lot of writing done You're a writer? (Stewie groans) I-I like to consider myself an observer. (chuckles) You have nice breasts, for instance. (chuckles) You want to join me? Guy with glasses can't be all bad. Thanks. Boy, it's loud in here, huh? Wh-When they said ""Professor Griffin,"" I barely heard them. That's it, I'm putting an end to this. I'm gonna destroy those glasses if it's the last thing I do. You should really check out the Thanksgiving jazz CD they sell here. (screaming) Where the hell are we? (footsteps echo) I heard something. Is is someone else here? Oh, my God, it's Hook-hand! He's coming for us! Damn it, why can't I get any reception? Because we're in a basement in the middle of nowhere. Besides, if cell phones worked, every movie would be two minutes long. Like An Affair to Remember. (tires screeching)   Darling, I was running to the Empire State Building to see you, but I got hit by a car. No wonder you were late. I'll be right down. Are you okay? I think I may be paralyzed. I'm sorry, there's nobody here by that name. (beeps)   Wow, Stewie, thanks for taking me to the spa. Hey, you deserve it, buddy. So just relax, take your glasses off, take a nice, dry sauna-- no glasses in the sauna-- just leave those puppies in the locker. They'll be safe out here. Sounds good. (quietly): Come on, Chris. Don't let me down."
S14e4,CHRIS:,"Don't worry, Stewie. Chris! What are you doing in here? I did it. I locked us in the sauna! You what?! Yep, it's all set. It's turned up high, and nobody is coming for the whole weekend. (pounding) (gasping, panting) Boy, you guys sure look steamed."
S14e4,ANNOUNCER:,"This Family Guy joke was written by Jimmy Sullivan, age nine, of Decatur, Georgia. Thanks, Jimmy! And we'll pass along your gross request to Mila Kunis. (water dripping) (footsteps approaching) Those footsteps are getting closer. Those aren't footsteps. It's an old building. Just relax. Besides, I can see an exit door right there. Where? Right there. Behind that guy with the hook-- (terrified screaming) (screaming) Everybody run! (Joe screaming) (thunder crashes) (screams) Wait a minute. There's four of us, and one of him. Yeah, let's get him! (yelling) Son of a bitch! Take that! Die, Hook-hand! You won't kill us! Um, Hook-hand's name is Albert, and he's dressed like a janitor. (groans) I've been trying to help you. I'm the caretaker here. Wait, you work here? But you have a hook hand. I was a soldier. I lost my hand saving six men in Korea. Oh, God, he's a war hero. (exhales) He's dead. What have we done? We killed an innocent man. Well, if this doesn't justify a McFlurry, nothing does. Oh, my God, we killed an innocent man. We-we've got to report this! We gotta turn ourselves in! No way. If we do that, we'll all go to jail. And I'm a cop. Do you know what they do to cops in jail? Hey, man? When you were a cop, did they-- did they let you use the siren? Yeah, it's part of the job. That's so cool! Hey, hey, when you were a cop, when you were going to a crime scene, did you go ""chung Chung,"" like Law & Order? No, that would be very unprofessional. All right, all right. Oh, hey, check it out, man, when you were a cop, did you ever, you know, use your handcuffs when you were getting kinky with your girl? No, it's city property, so you're not really supposed to take those home. Oh, for sure, for sure. Oh, hey, by the way, a bunch of us are gonna kill you in the shower later. Okay, so we're all on the same page, right? We bury the body, we never speak of this again. Deal. - Got it. Yup. Wow, that was exhausting. Wait a minute, is-is that-- is that his car? (car alarm wailing) Aw, crap, it's still alive! It does not feel like a Wednesday. Peter, I'm glad you're up. I need to talk to you about something. I know what you did last night. You do? How could you do something so heinous? Last night, you left your dirty dishes in the sink. It's disgusting. So I did half, and I left the other half for you. Ah, forget it. You'll just do it wrong. I'll wash 'em myself. Why don't you just go in the other room and relax? I'll call you when breakfast is ready. Okay."
S14e4,LOIS:,"Oh, my God, Peter, come look at the newspaper! ""Janitor dead."" (gasps) What? No! Right here. My college roommate, Jan Itter. She passed away yesterday. Are-are we really doin' this? 'Cause I didn't get, like, any sleep last night. What are you freaking out about? You didn't even know her. Yeah, yeah, yeah, y-you're right, you're right."
S14e4,LOIS:,"You and the guys killed and buried a man?! Ah, I knew you'd find out! Find out what? I just got David Sedaris' new book, You and the Guys Killed and Buried a Man. Okay, I am really on edge and this thing we're doin', I'm not happy about it, and that's a very odd title for a humorist's book. Peter, you're acting very weird. Just go in the other room. I don't want to go in the other room, I want to stay here and see what you're seeing, because you're saying things that I think are somethin' totally different than what they are. Peter, you're gonna have a heart attack. I won't say anything, I'll let you relax."
S14e4,LOIS:,"""They found a body of a war hero down by the old asylum!"" Okay, that has to be something. (song playing on radio) Oh, sorry, Peter, I'm just singing along with this old John Mellencamp song.  They went up there to write a movie   Peter, Quagmire, Cleveland and Joe   Killed the old janitor war hero   Just why, we'll never know  I don't remember this one. Guess it's never been in a car commercial.  In a truck that's built Dodge Tough!  Oh, yeah, no, I know this one. (whistling) Hey, Bri? Yeah? Aah! Damn it! Aah! There's glass in my eye! Oh! Son of a bitch! Aah! Mom says dinner's at 6:00. She wanted me to tell people, I don't know why. (groaning) Guys, I'm kind of freaking out about killing that guy. Anybody else have a hard time sleeping? No, but there's an old John Mellencamp song you're not gonna (bleep) believe. Wait, w-what's all this stuff about you guys killing someone? Last night, at the asylum. We killed that war hero. Whoa, whoa, what?! You-you really killed someone? Holy moly, I don't think I want to hear this. Quagmire, you were there with us. You're so weird. Last night, I was in St. Louis. I even have a picture. See that? That's yesterday's date on that newspaper. On The Quahog Informant? They sell The Quahog Informant in St. Louis? Well, probably, but good luck with that whole ""you three and not me killed a guy"" thing. Damn it, that bastard is bailing on us. He's a worse accomplice than Johnny Wind Chimes. (chimes chiming) Hey! Shh! (loudly): Sorry! It's my chimes. I hate to frame you like this, Quagmire, but I gotta. I can't go to jail! They'll razz me good on account of my belly. Cleveland? What are you doing here? What are you both doing here? Joe? What the hell?"
S14e4,QUAGMIRE:,"You backstabbers. What the hell's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. Cleveland's tryin' to frame me. He's got my miniature portraits of cool guys. Peter, those are baseball cards. Whatever. He's using it to frame me for murder! Well, I'm not the only one. Joe's got my Sports Illustrated football phone. He was using this as his main phone. It is a mess over there. Look at all you pathetic people, bringing stuff to frame each other. You're supposed to be friends. Hey, that's my shovel! Damn right! That's how smart I am, I only had to bring one thing! This way I can dig the hole and just throw this in! But once you throw it in there, how you gonna get the dirt back on top? Give me your shovel! You're gonna have to kill me first! Not with my shovel! That's brand-new! Give me back my rattle-y plastic phone!   Wait, wait, wait, guys! Guys! What? Don't you see? This! This is our horror movie! (thunder crashes)   It doesn't feel like a Wednesday. Boy, that sucked. Yeah, I guess writing a movie isn't as easy as Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes it look. Hey, at least we gave it a shot. I just feel bad we killed an innocent man. Well, don't feel too bad. Look at that! Oh, my God! Wow, that's a relief! We may have actually made this town a better place. Yeah, what a monster. But at least now he's gone forever."
S14e5,ANNOUNCER:,"Hey, guys, do you like beer, but can't get drunk from beer? Then try new Vodka Beer. The can says ""beer,"" but inside is 12 ounces of carbonated vodka. And the best part is, your wife will never know. Honey, I'm so proud of you, cutting down to one beer a night. (slurring): Take off your underwear. She don't know. I got the mail. Hey, does an octopus live here? Peter, that says ""occupant."" Oh, that's too bad. That would've been awesome. Oh look, Peter. Here's something from your mother's estate. Oh, looks like they finally sold her house. And the last white domino in that neighborhood falls. Wow, they sold it? So that means the house and everything inside of it is gone? Oh, sweetheart. You thinking about all the good times you had there? No, I'm thinking about my teenage porn stash. It's still hidden in the house. Oh, okay, but I know this is really about the memories. Lactating sluts on box springs. The-The-The special times growing up Bikini black chicks sneezing. Lois, stop making him reminisce about stuff. You don't understand, Lois. A boy's first collection of nudie books and girlie movies is a sacred thing. It can't fall into a stranger's hands. This is very serious. I'm taking us to DEFCON 4. (sign buzzes) What happens when it hits DEFCON 1? We see a dog wearing a wig. Aw, heck, let's see that anyway. (Peter chuckles) That's not even a lady dog. Hey, Peter, what's wrong? You've been real quiet. I don't know, Quagmire. I keep thinking of my old pornos. It's like I'm reminded of them everywhere I look. You've been looking at Cleveland a lot. Plus, you know, when people find that box, they won't know that, like, for some of them magazines, I just had them as, like, a joke. You know, not 'cause, like, I was really into it. Just the opposite. For some of them magazines. Okay. I'm going to be arrested for sure. Peter, I know exactly where you're coming from. You, Quagmire? You enjoy pornography, too? Yup, and I know that a man's porn collection must be secured and protected at all costs, until he gets ashamed of it and ditches it in an alley behind a Kroger's. Hey, I know! What if we break into my old house and steal back my big box of pornos? What do you say? You guys with me? You bet. Sure thing, Peter. I mean, come on, we're a team. Like fish and chips and fat guys. I want the double cheeseburger, but I'm gonna go healthy and get the fish and chips."
S14e5,ANNOUNCER:,"Fish and chips! (singing jauntily): Okay, you all remember the plan-- we walk up wearing our Bill Cosby masks Peter, that's President Obama. Aw, did I just do a racism? (knocking on window) Hello? Can I help you gentlemen? Hi. You guys have been sitting in front of my house for the last five hours trying on Obama masks. Is there something I can do for you? We, uh we-we were just getting ready to break into your house. Excuse me? Oh, hey, cool shirt. What? Oh, thank you. Look, what's this all about? This guy used to live in your house and a box of his old porn is still hidden in there. We were gonna break in and take it. And I was gonna stay with the rental van because it's my name what's on the contract. Oh. Well, you could've just knocked on the door and asked. I don't want that stuff, I've got kids. Get it out of there! Really? Awesome! Oh, well that was easier than a game of Pai Gow poker. Pai gow. You lose again! That was awesome! I can't believe these tables are always empty. You play again? Nope, out of money. I'm just gonna wait for my drink. Who had the full glass of Goldschlager? Ah. Sorry, can't tip. I'm gonna take this up to my room. Oh, I'm on the wrong floor. (vacuum whirring) Almost time for lunch. Ah How was everything? Delicious. The prime rib was mostly fat. Should I charge it to your room? No, I had to check out, even though my flight's not until midnight. Now, how does one with no money get to the airport? (horn honking) (honking) Hey, buddy, you're blocking the outlet. Oh, sorry. There was no chairs. Hi, Peter. How was Vegas? Oh, it's the best. Sweet. Now, which movie should I start with? ""Back-Door Sluts 4."" Eh, I haven't seen the first three, I wouldn't know what's going on. Here we go. I want to watch all of these movies, nonstop. I don't want to watch any more of these movies, ever. Hey, Brian, you want to go for a ride to behind the Kroger's? What? That's weird. What's that? Hello, Future Peter. Hi. By the time you watch this, you'll be grown-up, so I'm sure you're allowed to eat ice cream and pizza for every meal. You know it. Also, I bet you're a big important doctor like that Doogie Howser kid who's getting so much ass. Well, I was partly right. I just hope to God you're not stuck in some loser job, like in a brewery, or a toy factory, or a fishing boat. Oh, boy. But, you know, I don't have to worry about none of that. I'm sure you're a big, successful doctor. Anyway, here's some Conway Twitty.  I know it's only make believe  This is annoying. I don't want to sit through this. Man, I guess I ain't the big success I thought I'd be. I know what you mean, Peter. When I was young, I thought that someday I'd produce upworthy web content. Am I doing it? Yes. But not everyone is so lucky. (sighs) Damn it, I suck. I've never done anything important. Well, except for when I beat Larry Bird for a Big Mac. Off the floor, off the scoreboard, off the backboard, no rim.   Right near the basket, underhanded, effeminate gasp, over the backboard, out of bounds, waddle over to get it, slip on a towel, twist my ankle, go to the emergency room, doctors tell me it's not that bad and I shouldn't have come there, I make them give me a cast anyway, never play sports again. Hey, I won the two-dollar sandwich.  Highway to the danger zone  Look at me. I was beautiful. What are you watching? It's just a teenage loser who didn't realize he had no future in front of him. Well, when you're done with this, Stewie is trapped between his crib and the wall."
S14e5,STEWIE:,Help. Somebody help! He's watching an old video.
S14e5,STEWIE:,"Okay, when he's done then.  Gonna take you right into the danger zone  Oh, my God! He's just rhyming ""danger zone"" with ""danger zone."" Holy crap! Chris, I was just like you! What? Listen to me, Chris. I'm a failure in life, and that's all I'll ever be. But it's not too late for you. I won't let you go down my path. What are you saying, Dad? I'm saying, Chris, I am going to make sure that you grow up to be a success. Yeah, I'm going to be a success! Uh, would you excuse me for a moment? Computer, what does ""success"" mean? Chris, let me know when you're done with the computer. Whoa, whoa, whoa! No TV for you, Chris. TV is how stupid losers spend their time. Peter, what is this all about? I'm trying to save our son, Lois. I don't want him to end up like me-- dead-end job, crappy house, aging wife who's getting skinny where fat's supposed to be, and fat where skinny's supposed to be. Ha! Meg, go to your room. Look, Peter, I'm glad you're thinking about Chris' future, but he's fine. He's a perfectly normal kid. Are you crazy? Look at him. He's over there intentionally giving himself a nosebleed. Yay! My nose is finally a woman! Okay, so maybe he's a little rough around the edges, but-- Oh, boy, a little got in my mouth there. Yeah, I'm gonna have to wash this shirt. Anyway, I'm going to help Chris become a big, important success. The same way Mumford turned his son into a success. Okay, Dad, heading out to the concert. Now, hold on a minute, son. Where are your arm garters? Your string tie? Your woolen vest? You look nothing like a dry goods clerk from the Garfield administration. But, Dad No buts! You're a Mumford. Now get upstairs, put on a jaunty travelling hat, and write the same song Okay, now, Chris, if you want to be a success, you gotta look worldly and sophisticated. And to do that, you got to dress like Lenny Kravitz, with little something from every part of he world pinned on you. Leather bracelets! Nipple ring! Zippers where zippers shouldn't be! Wilma Flintstone pearl necklaces! A fur shrug with crocheted sleeves! A hat on a hat! A watch on your pinky toe! And nothing says, ""Look at me, I've been places"" like two lit road flares hanging from your sunglasses. Hey, you look like you've been places. Stop looking at me! I do not want this attention! Come on, Chris, let's get out of here. Uh, what are you doing? Well, I been trying to make Chris less of a fat dummy, and nothing seems to be working, so now we're high-stepping around in giant hats. Tip of the giant hat, sir. And to you, sir! Yes, sir, smart day to you, sir. And I thank you, sir. (yelps) (cries) I scraped my knee bad! Get up, Chris, you're embarrassing yourself. You look stupid and fat. Peter, I have to ask-- are you pushing Chris so hard because it's what's best for him? Or are you trying to make up or your own disappointment about how your life turned out? Brian, these are the biggest hats I could find, so if your point is that there's even larger ones available, I would greet that with skepticism. No, no, no, my point is that you need to let Chris find his own path. (gasps) Oh, my God, you're right, Brian. He needs to be pointed to a very specific path. And then forced to go down it. No, no, that's-that's the opposite of what I just said. Chris, your best chance for success is to be cultured and worldly, like our dog. So starting right now, you gotta follow Brian around and do everything he does. What?! Come on, Brian. You gotta show Chris how to turn out better than me. I mean, you went to Brown, you're a published author, you can hear it first when Joe falls out of the tub. That's starting to happen more often. But I guess you're right. Maybe I am the guy to make a diamond out of this lump of coal. But only if it's what Chris wants. I don't care. All right, I'll do it. Just follow my lead, Chris. 'Cause I think you could be something great. Who knows? Maybe you'll even become one of those mission control leaders who gets all thoughtful while everybody's celebrating. Apollo 13, this is Mission Control, do you copy? Apollo 13, this is mission control, do you copy? Do you copy, Apollo 13? (static hissing) Mission Control, this is Apollo 13. We're all okay. Good to be home. (cheering) (sighs) Sir, you did it! Sir, is everything okay? Eh, I bought a Nook e-reader a couple of years ago and I'm still pissed about it.         Hey. Hey. Chew that way. Eh, dinner's no fun without Chris here. There's nobody here for me to wing my biscuit at. Well, Peter, he's been spending an awful lot of time with Bri-- Eh, it's not the same. Anyway, he and Brian have been spending a lot of time together. Really? You're going to let that slide? Guy throws a biscuit at you? Good evening, all. Apologies for being so tardy. Aw, Chris, you're not tardy. We tested you twice. There you guys are. We were wondering about you. Brian and I have been having a blast. First we went to a symphony. Then we saw a small independent play with real smoking in it. And then we hit the Quahog Book Festival and went to a Q and A to ask questions that weren't really questions. Wow, look at my sophisticated young man. You're certainly taking to Brian's example. If anything, he's teaching me. I mean, not really, but you-you know. Aw, see, I knew Brian could put Chris on the path to success. Hey, Chris, let's celebrate. There's a new baby panda at the zoo. How about you and me go chuck tater tots at it? Chuck them at Lois. She'll just sit there and take it. (chuckling): Oh, Dad. That would've been fine for the old me, but Brian and I have to be going. Oh. Okay. Yeah, we're off to see an old movie on temporary screen in a muddy, freezing park. That sounds awful. (chuckling): It is awful. But at least parking will be impossible. Bye! Geez, I feel like I just lost my son. Aw, I got a skin tag in my crack and it stings when I don't wipe right. This has been a bad dinner. There you two are. Sit down and join us. I can't stay, Mom. Brian's showing me all of his favorite stuff to do. Getting spooked when the furnace goes on? We're participating in an autism walk. Looks like you're doing it right now. And we may be gone a while, 'cause after that we're going down to the Civic Center. Michael Ian Black is cocking his eyebrows for four hours. Ha! He says the things we don't care to say. Bye! Man, I'm sick of how much time Chris is spending with Brian. Probably smooching pickles, 'cause they're a couple of pickle smoochers. It's like he ain't even my son no more, doing all that fancy-pants stuff. Oh, Peter, I know you miss him, but this is what you wanted, isn't it? Well, yeah, but I didn't realize bettering himself meant blowing off his old man. You know what? The hell with this. I want my son back. Peter, relax. Chris is just going through a phase. He'll grow out of it. Just like you grew out of your ""Walk Like An Egyptian"" phase. Paul was a good man. A good friend. I'll I'll always remember how supportive he was when I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't-I can't- I can't do this. Check it out, Lois-- when Chris notices that ""World's Greatest Son"" mug I made, he'll be back on board with his old man in no time. Hey, Chris, what's on the mug? ""World's Greatest Sun."" This world only has one sun. What kind of idiot made this mug?  When everything's made to be broken  (crying)  I just want you to know who I am.  (Pharrell William's ""Happy"" begins)  It might seems crazy what I'm about to say  I'm very easily influenced by music. All right, Chris, now I know you're all sophisticated now, but no man can resist the siren call of mentally impaired supermodel Kate Upton. Mm, sorry, Dad. I'm more of a Catherine Keener man now. But, Chris, you got to take advantage. The clock's ticking on Kate Upton. She's almost at the end of her window. (timer dings) Yup, we missed it. Come on, get out of here. (grunting) Sorry, Lois, I need the TV. I gotta win my son back. What are you talking about, Peter? Well, you know how Brian's got Chris watching all them fancy foreign films now? Well, I figure I can lure Chris in with this French movie-- Le RocquÃ© Trois. (accordion plays Rocky theme with French lilt) ADRIENNE (French accent): RocquÃ©! ROCKY (French accent): Adrienne! RocquÃ©! Adrienne! MAN (French accent): J'pitÃ© Le fool."
S14e5,ROCKY:,"Oh, Clubbert Lange! Peter, this is pointless. You wanted Chris to be a better person with a bright future, and thanks to Brian, that's what he has now. Yeah, but, I don't even recognize Chris these days. And I never get to spend time with him. It's like Chris ain't my friend no more. Thanks for coming to the book club meeting, everyone. Well, I gotta say, I loved this week's book-- Annie Proulx's The Shipping News. Yes, yes! Yes. Very Portnoy's Complaint. Uh, I don't What, uh, what do you mean by that? Oh, you know, just with the-the port, and the shipping. And of course, in Portnoy's Complaint you've got the guy who's living near the water That doesn't sound right. and he hated the noise from the local port, so he filed one of the very first port noise complaints in maritime law. And for those of us who read the complaints, trust me, they were very warranted. Brian, could I talk to you over here? Oh, let's dog-ear this for a sec. (chuckles) This one gets it. Brian, what the hell are you talking about? You clearly haven't read either of those books. Whoa, Chris, now you're starting to sound like Mark Twain, whose real name was Samuel Clemens. Oh, that is so your go-to! I can't believe you. I thought you were this worldly, sophisticated guy, but you're just a fraud-- like Moses. And the Lord's Eleventh Commandment-- ""Moses gets to be first in line at the buffet."" What?! Oh, seriously? I know, you guys, it's so lame, but that's what it says. Why are you doing that? Why are you hucking tater tots at a baby panda? 'Cause I'm oddly attracted to him and it frightens me. See, this is why you're so great, Dad. You don't pretend to be someone you're not. You do what you want, and you don't care what anyone thinks. Well, I-I care what you think. Look, Chris, you're my kid, and I want what's best for you, but I guess I just don't want you to become too good for your old man. Don't worry, Dad. I could never be too good for you because you're the best. And I want to be just like you when I grow up. Really? Aw, thanks, Chris. Tater tot? It's fun, right? Yeah! And the mama panda doesn't do anything about it, because she was blinded to make her more submissive. Ha-ha! You're right. You know, Chris, all this started 'cause I was feeling bad about being a failure. But you know what? I got you for a son. So maybe I did something right. I love you, Dad. Come on, Chris. Let's go get an $18 Coke at the terrible zoo restaurant. Yay! Sticky tables covered in bees! Coming up, we'll tell you where to look when talking to a coworker in the bathroom. The answer might surprise you. Well, I think we all learned something today. In other news, TVs still make noise, even when people resume their conversations. Yes, studies have determined That's right, Peter. And it's the most important lesson. (Tom continues) Everyone should be who they are. Success is being true to yourself. Amen, Mom. (Tom continues) But to have the love of your family, that's true success. Let's go ahead and turn off the TV."
S14e5,TOM:,There we go.
S14e6,ANNOUNCER:,"We now return to Guy Friends. So, you must be pretty pumped. For what? Oh. Olympics. Oh, yeah. I guess that's starting soon. I thought you were a big Olympics guy. Yeah, I like 'em okay. Huh.  Guy friends   A computer made us roommates in college   That's why we're friends   Guy friends!  Mail's here. Any fliers of Hispanic women running for city council? Yeah, there is. Thank you. Peter, you got a letter from your sister Karen. What? You've got a sister, Dad? How come we've never met her? Is she a prim and proper aunt (""ONT"") or a big, fat, dirty aunt (""ANT"")? I have no obligation to tell any of you anything. Mr. Griffin has shown good faith in appearing here today and will not be subjected to this sort of hostile interrogation. Your father doesn't like to talk about his sister, Meg. They've never really gotten along. Wow, Peter. In all the years I've known you, you've never even mentioned a sister. Big deal, I don't talk about my sister. I also don't talk about that tickling uncle. All right, Uncle Dan, remember: no tickling. (chuckles) You got it. (laughing) You didn't say anything about Uncle Neil. Whose uncles are you? It says here your sister's coming for Thanksgiving. She what?"
S14e6,CHRIS:,"If we're having guests, can I invite Rosario Vargas from the third district, a leader you can depend on? I don't want Karen here. Peter, you've been avoiding your sister for too long. Besides, she says she's been having Thanksgiving with your mother for the last 20 years. And now that your mom has passed, she'd like to spend Thanksgiving with you. (whispering) No. Peter, Karen's coming and that's that. How cool! I didn't even know I had an aunt. I can't wait to meet her. Look, I'm telling you guys, it's gonna be a disaster. Just like the alternate ending of Back to the Future.   Well, if I'm gonna disappear into nothing, I might as well bang my mom. Hey, Lorraine, wait up! Hi! My name's Marty! I'm in a picture!   To be contondered! TV"
S14e6,ANNOUNCER:,"We now return to The Cosby Show, knowing what we know now. (The Cosby Show theme playing) Huh. I was so busy not seeing color, I didn't see the raping, either. Okay, everyone. It'll be another hour before the turkey's done, but I made more appetizers. Ooh, grape jelly on a Triscuit. You're a whiz. Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. Save your appetite. And don't think I haven't noticed you've already had two drinks. You're, like, all the worst parts of a girlfriend. (doorbell rings) Oh. That must be Karen. I'll get it. Aunt Karen? And you must be Meg. Do that to me! (giggling) Wow, it's so cool that I've got an aunt I didn't know about. Oh, Karen, I'm so happy you could make it. Lois Pewterschmidt. The one that got away. I'm just joshing, kid. Auntie's not a biscuit-bumper. (laughter) (laughs) I'm not, either! (laughs) Peter, come say hello to your sister. (sighs) Fine. Hey, Karen. Welcome to our Bring it in, Pee Pee! (farts) (laughter) I like her. Hello. I am City Councilwoman Rosario Vargas. Quahog doesn't work if it doesn't work for all of us. That's a beautiful pantsuit, Ms. Vargas. Wow, Karen, nice to meet you. I'm Glenn Quagmire. I didn't know Peter even had a sister. What are you, ashamed of me, Chin Nuts? Oh, my God. His chin kind of does look like nuts. Ha, ha! I never noticed that. How could you not notice it? Watch this, I-I'll punch him in the nuts. Eh, sort of clever. Wait a second. I know you. You're that lady wrestler. Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's right. Hey, w-what do they call you again? Heavy Flo. You're Heavy Flo! In the flesh and blood. Gross. Man, you're amazing. I remember when you called out Andrea the Giant the day after September 11. What just happened was a national tragedy, but it's nothing compared to what I'm gonna do to Andrea the Giant! We will never forget what happened yesterday, but you'll also never forget what's gonna happen September 17 at the Jack Witschi Sports Arena! Peter, I can't believe you've kept your sister a secret. She's amazing! Yeah, she's crazy strong. Like Superman on a date. Yeah, I wasn't here, but I heard her scream, so I came flying in and found her like this. It's weird. Same cause of death as those three guys in that local public bathroom. Unsolvable. Now do you see why I didn't want Karen here, Lois? She terrorized me my whole childhood. Now she's got to embarrass me in front of my friends? Peter, Bonnie just changed Joe on the table. What are you worried about? Still, I don't want to go back out there. Look, I know you've had your differences, but Karen's your sister. And you're grown-ups now. Can't you just go out there and pretend to have a good time? Fine, I'll play along. I guess I've lied before. Where you going? Home. Where's home? The White House. Okay, I'm here. This is my house. You can go now. Thanks for taking me home. Go ahead, go inside. I will. You can drive away now. No, no, I-I want to make sure you get inside safe. Yeah, but I-I got to look through the mail first. You know how it is. Really, I insist. I-It's totally okay. Go. At this point, it's more about me than it is you. It's a bad neighborhood. If I don't see you go inside, I'll be thinking about it all night. (sighs) (whispering) Uh come on in, Mr. President! (laughter) And then, so I'm like, ""Peter, how was I supposed to know you didn't want your teammates to know you wore a bra?"" (laughter) It was a custom-designed sports halter top. More stories! More stories! Hey, tell one where Peter is a nincompoop or maybe a Silly Billy. (laughs) Oh, man. Okay, let's just carve the turkey. Oh, Aunt Karen already carved it. She did? But that's my thing. I always do my ""are you a leg man or a breast man"" joke. Aunt Karen did that, too. It was hilarious. I never really got it until she said it. Ha, ha! Hey, Karen, later you got to show us some of your wrestling holds. Yeah, what's that trademark finishing move of yours? The Toxic Shock. Oh, yeah, that move is badass! You're awesome. Know what else is awesome? This stuffing. Thank you, Glenn. You're welcome. I'm in a good mood. Sure, what the hell, I'll show you my moves. Maybe after dinner. No, no, no. The family football game is after dinner. We do it every year! Peter, calm down. You're making a scene. It's not my fault, Lois. She's ruining Thanksgiving! The way Tim Burton ruined the Fourth of July!  Spooky! Happy! Spooky! Happy!   Weirdness! Weirdness!   Spooky! Happy!   La, la, la!   Weirdness, weirdness   Patriotic weirdness   Barbecuing human heads   Every president is dead   Everybody's gonna die   Have a dark and dead July!  (yowls) Fat chicks with black hair get tattoos of me! God, I love this time of year. It's just past all the amazing colors of fall, and before the white of winter. Just brown and gray. Magical. All right, let's do this. All right, listen up, I'm the captain. The teams are chosen by a lottery system where Aunt Karen, can I be on your team? Yeah, yeah, me, too! Uh, yeah, sure, I'll take, uh, Meg, Skinny, Hot Chocolate and The Bus. Pee Pee, you get the crumbs. Let's go. All right, let's do it, Pop! I'm gonna make some sports points for you! We'll kick off. Hey, time-out! Did anyone tape the parade? Please tell me someone taped the parade! (grunts) (sighs) (groaning) Oh, my God! She's doing The Toxic Shock! (groaning) (gasping, wheezing) Y-Y-You're a j-jerk, K-K-Karen! What the hell was that? That's his stutter. And whenever he stutters, he usually pees his pants. N-No, I d-d-don't. (groans): Oh. So this is football. I like it. Hi, Dad. Look, I-I just want you to know, I feel bad about what happened with you and Aunt Karen the other day. Oh, you mean when she put me in that no-bottom James Bond chair and assaulted my grundle? I didn't even know about that. Well, that's 'cause it didn't happen. I'd kick her ass if she tried something like that! Dad, stop. Even I can see that your sister's a huge bully. And trust me, I know more about getting bullied than anyone. You do? How?  Celebrate good times, come on   Let's celebrate   Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh   Celebrate good times, come on.  Man, I love that song. Dad, what I'm trying to tell you is, I now see why you've been so tough on me all these years. 'Cause it makes my friends laugh? No, because that's how Aunt Karen treated you when you were a kid. (gasps loudly) That's right. And that's why you need to confront Karen. Oh, no. Oh, no. No, I can't do that. I tried for years to stand up to her. Nothing ever worked. What, so now you're gonna quit? You can't quit. What if Muhammad Ali had quit? Ah, my grandchildren! Who would like me to read them a book, or maybe paint their name on a grain of rice? Honey, dinnertime! Ah, my favorite. Hot soup. Right in there. Dad, I know you can stand up to Aunt Karen. And maybe if you finally do, she'll stop terrorizing you, and you won't have to take it out on me for the rest of my life. You know what, Meg? You're right! I'm gonna do it! You are? Damn right! Yay, Dad! I am gonna become a lady wrestler and defeat Heavy Flo in the ring. Wait. What?! No! What?! I meant go talk to her. Nope, it's got to be a lady wrestling match. Hey, Meg, Thanksgiving's over. Come help me with the Christmas decorations. Meg! Help me with the Christmas decorations! Comments? Questions? What the hell are you I'm sorry. Chris had his hand up first. Chris? What's the capital of Maryland? I do not know, but that's a very good question. Now, Lois? Peter, what the hell are you doing?! First, it's not Peter. When I am in this outfit, I am Maxi Paddy, the fiercest enemy of Heavy Flo. Peter, you look-- okay, that's clever-- but, Peter, you look ridiculous. Take that off. If you want to settle things with your sister, just go talk to her. No, Lois, the only way to settle a family dispute is in the cage. I mean, you don't understand. Karen made me feel worse than a guy getting cut from a baseball team. You wanted to see me, Coach? I'm sorry, Kyle. You can't do this boring, stupid thing with us. All right, Peter, your sister's the real deal. So I arranged for you to get some combat pointers from my old buddy, Steven Seagal. Uh, this this fat guy? Yup. Go on, ask him anything. How how did? Uh, why-why you so fat? Okay, ask him about anything but his weight. (sighs): Uh uh, you act Asian, you look Native American, your name is possibly Jewish. What are you? He fat. All right, Peter, most professional wrestlers become addicted to painkillers at some point. So I figure, why don't we just start now? Uh okay, yeah, I'm in. Where you getting all these? Stepdaughter's purse. Ain't my problem. Man, I love putting my hand down my pants when I'm on drugs. We should just go live on a boat in some guy's backyard. So, you gonna do that wrestling stuff? Nah, I'm gonna stick with these. I would crime for more of these. Okay, now if you're gonna defeat your sister in the ring, you got to get to the root of your fears. We got to go back to your childhood, so I'm gonna hypnotize you. Okay, go back. Now, we need to go back in time. (high-pitched voice): My jeans are husky. Okay, further. Further. Little further. Now, open your eyes and tell me what you see. (demonic voice): I see the six stations of the Lord's order, and they will all burn! Okay, too far! Too far! Too far! Come back. Come back. Come back. (high-pitched voice): Hey, can I make my husky jeans into cutoffs for swimming? Ah, forget it. You're ready. Yeah, Peter. I think you're gonna win! All right! Hey, thanks for all your help, you guys. You know, there's only two things I've wanted to do my whole life: put my sister in her place and go to Chico's Monkey Farm.    Chico's Monkey Farm   Come and have a howling good time   Ooh-ooh, aah-aah, ooh-ooh, aah-aah   Chico's Monkey Farm   The only drive-through monkey farm   In Northern Southern Rhode Island   Ooh, aah!   Chico's Monkey Farm   After a prolonged litigation, we're finally open again   Ooh, aah!   Chico's Monkey Farm   There's a fair amount of paperwork   Before you get to see a monkey so allow for extra time   Ooh, aah!   Chico's Monkey Farm   Keep your windows rolled up 'cause the monkeys   Will pry 'em open and they're known to strangle kids   Ooh-ooh-ooh, aah-aah-aah!"
S14e6,ANNOUNCER:,"Chico's Monkey Farm! Now open pending how it goes. (crowd cheering) (grunting) And we've got quite a match tonight between Heavy Flo and another woman whose name I've forgotten but I'm sure is a gross pun. Right you are, Bill. Tonight, she's up against Her Vajesty's Secret Cervix. Interesting fact: these two gals have over eight meters of ass crack between them. One! Two! Three! (crowd cheering) It's over! And once again, a Heavy Flo has ruined another lady's evening! (cheering continues)"
S14e6,PETER:,"You ain't no champ! Not till you go through me! Who the hell are you?! I'm Maxi Paddy, which is short for Maxine Patricia. I was named after my father, Maxwell Patrick. But that's enough about me. I'm here to kick your ass! Get out of here! I'm not fighting some fat loser from the crowd. Huh. It looks like this Heavy Flo is pee, because you're yellow!"
S14e6,CROWD:,"Oh! Well, that didn't quite track, but the crowd seems to be on board. It sure does! Looks like Heavy Flo has a challenger! All right, get up here, but make it quick. I got a Lampoon reunion to get to. Heavy Flo, always finding a way to drop her Harvard degree into conversation. Yes, very off-putting, Bill. Those of us who went to Harvard really don't appreciate it. (bell dings) (grunting) Ow! Damn it, Karen! Karen? Peter, is that you? What are you doing here? Something I should have done a long time ago. I'm tired of you bullying me! You're going down!"
S14e6,VENDOR:,"Butt-scratcher?! Butt-scratcher!   (grunting) D-D-D-Don't, K-K-Karen! CROWD (chanting): Toxic Shock! Toxic Shock! Oh, my God, she's taking it too far! Heavy Flo is gonna break this girl's arms! Woman's arms. Come on, Bill. N-N-No! Tell Stewie he's in charge of the show now. Say hello to Teen LaQueefa! One! Two! Three! (crowd cheering) I don't believe it! Heavy Flo is down, and we have a new champion! I tell you, this is one for the books, if anyone kept track of this nonsense! Wow, you really saved me! Thanks, stranger. Dad, it's me. (gasps) Meg? It was you who saved me? That's right, Dad. Wow, even after all the crummy stuff I've done to you? But why? Because you're my dad. And I couldn't stand by and watch you get hurt. Wow. Thanks, Meg. You know, that's something even my own mom and dad never did for me. They just stood by and let Karen pick on me. Well, you deserve better. We all do. You know, Meg, I'm really sorry I treated you so badly over the years. I guess I was taking out all the pain I felt on you. I understand. Better than anybody. But I still love you, Dad. I love you, too, Meg. Did somebody order a hot-ass bitch and this lady? Oh, you're alive. Sorry, I was told I was in charge now. Well, if you die, this is kind of the creative direction I'm leaning toward. Well, I'm proud of you, Dad. You finally stood up for yourself. So, Peter, have you talked to Karen? I called, like, four times, but she's not out of the coma yet. Apparently, they usually use fake chairs, but Meg used a real one. Do they think she's gonna survive? It could go either way. (phone ringing) Hello? No, I think I'm a different blood type. No, I don't want to check. Doctor says there's nothing they can do."
S14e7,PETER:,"I'm not buyin' you that coat! (door slams) (snores, coughing) Huh? Who? What? Yeah, what? What? Which doggy in what window? So, how'd everything go? Hard to tell. I was coughing the whole time. By the way, I couldn't figure out how to use your oven, so I destroyed it in a blind rage. Well, good night. Ooh, after that steak, I got to go lay down on the toilet. (phone vibrates) Huh. Looks like I got a couple of messages. (banging sounds on voicemail)"
S14e7,STEWIE:,"Uh, Dad? Dad? Grandpa's going nuts on the oven. Can you come home quick? Who the hell is that? Huh. There's one from Quagmire. (muffled conversation) Huh, must've pocket-dialed me again."
S14e7,QUAGMIRE:,"I want Lois. She's perfect. I've loved her for years. She's warm and kind and beautiful. I've never been so in love with anyone. Oh, my God. Quagmire's in love with my wife? (phone rings) Hello?"
S14e7,LOIS:,"Peter, I'm having troubles on the toilet. Bring the ice cream maker. Brian, there's somethin' I got to talk to you about. Quagmire pocket-dialed me last night. You got to hear this."
S14e7,QUAGMIRE:,"I want Lois. She's perfect. I've loved her for years. Oh, my God! He's in love with Lois? Yeah, and if you keep listenin', you can hear a Puerto Rican busboy get fired in the background. It's pretty funny. He cries. But can you believe Quagmire?! Well, I guess it's not that shocking. I mean, he has said 100 times that he wants to bang Lois. No, no, no, that's just Quagmire bein' a horndog. This is love. I don't know, I think you're making too big a deal out of this. Too big a deal?! The guy's been sitting next to me all these years, acting like he's my friend, when all he really wants is to be with my wife! Geez, calm down. No, I'm telling you, he's gonna try to take Lois away from me. You know what? I'm going over there right now and hit him with a shovel, like a white trash YouTube girl. Peter, wait, wait. Listen. Delete that message and pretend you never heard it. What? Why? Because you weren't meant to hear it. If you act on this, all you'll do is wreck your friendship and cause heartache for everyone involved. What, so what am I supposed to do, just ignore it? Yeah. Ignore it. Like you do with the ghost of that colonial woman who died falling down our stairs. (moaning): I saw you eat a crayon It was purple. I thought it was grape. Look, you've got to be the bigger man. You got to just keep this to yourself. (sighs) Fine, I won't say anything. Good. And don't be passive-aggressive, either. Like one of those songs in an old musical. (jaunty melody plays)  You're hideous   To be without   You're big and fat   In the heart, no doubt   You're a horrible loss   If you won't be my wife   You're a raging, continuous   Love in my life  Pretty good turnout for this thing. Oh, yeah, Mort and Neil Goldman. It's like Coachella. There's that son of a bitch! He's got some nerve showing up here. Peter, remember what we talked about. Look at them clouds up there. Yeah, that one look like Nathan. That one look like Shawn. And there go Wanya over there. How blessed are we to have all them Boyz II Men just floating around in the sky? Glenn! Ida! You made it! Hey, Lois. I brought the hamburger buns, like you wanted. I wasn't sure what people like, so I got some with seeds on them and some without. What does he mean by that, ""seeds""? Like semen? Is that what he means? Semen on her buns. Am I the only one hearing this? Get the hell away from my wife, you scumbag! Peter, what are you talking about? I'll tell you what I'm talking about! I'm talking about this! PETER (recorded): Idea for a movie. Fop Cop. It's a cop who's, like, a fancy guy. Nobody heard that! None of you take that! What I meant to play was this."
S14e7,QUAGMIRE:,"I want Lois. She's perfect. I've loved her for years. Fop Cop. That could work. Glenn i-is this true? Wait a minute, how the hell'd you get that recording, Peter? You pocket-dialed me, you bastard! Peter, that was a private conversation. That doesn't change the fact that you want to steal my wife! Hey, get your hands off me!"
S14e7,LOIS:,"Oh, my God!"
S14e7,JOE:,"Oh, come on, you two."
S14e7,MAN:,"Come on, man. Hey, what are y'all doing? Someone stop him! Kill him, Dad! Murder him! (Quagmire and Peter grunting) That's it! End of cookout! Get out of my house, and don't ever speak to me again! Wow, that turned ugly fast. Just like my trip to Tampa Bay. Hey, city boy, what's with the arm pants? QUAGMIRE (recorded): I want Lois. She's perfect. I've loved her for years. (groans) You're still listening to that thing? It's like, I can't even process why he'd feel this way. Maybe you know, maybe play it one more time and I can't believe this. I thought Quagmire was my friend! Peter, it's not that surprising. He's always had a potent sex drive. Remember his grandmother's funeral? (quietly): Yeah, get it in there. Oh, I wish this was about sex. If he was just home busting one to his buddy's wife, hell, we've all done that. I've heard. Allegedly. But not often. And never to Donna. Except when she wore those shiny gold shorts to parent-teacher night. Oh, yeah, that was hilarious. (laughing): Yeah, that was that was so tacky. But Quagmire actually has feelings for you. I'm afraid he might take you away from me. Peter, nobody's taking me anywhere. I love you. Mmm. I love you, too, Lois. Hey, you ever heard any of the other wives saying they're attracted to me? (laughs) No, um, not that I recall, no. Look, now that this is settled, maybe you and Glenn can put this behind you. No way! How am I supposed to be friends with someone who's in love with my wife? Quagmire is dead to me and needs to be dealt with in an appropriate manner. Shame. Shame. Shame. (bell ringing) Shame. (to ""Chain of Fools""):  Shame, shame, shame   Shame on you-hoo   Shame, shame, shame   Shame on Q  This was serious, but it turned into something fun. Glenn? Is that you? Oh, yeah, yeah. I was just buying a a grocery store cane. See you, Lois. Glenn, wait. Look, if you and Peter aren't gonna talk this out, you and I should. What's there to talk about? Everyone knows I'm in love with my best friend's wife. It's pathetic. And humiliating. Glenn I can't trust myself around you. It's probably best if I just never see you again. Well, you can't just avoid me forever. We live on the same street. Mm. Well, then I know what I have to do. Good-bye, Lois.   Oh, sour cream. You wanted me to remind you. Sour cream. Mr. Quagmire, which box do these beads go in? Let me smell 'em. They go in the big box. Quagmire, I can't believe you're moving. Look, give it time-- this whole thing will blow over. No, it's too awkward. It's best for everyone if I just leave. That's too bad. We never got to do that ""Joe-Quagmire"" lunch. Well, that'll do it. Peter, Quagmire's serious about this. You got to do something! You're right. Quagmire, wait! You almost left without this! You want me to be the one that says ""jiggety"" now? TV"
S14e7,ANNOUNCER:,"We now return to Dateline. Our story tonight: The guy you think did it? He did it. Now go to bed. Your grandkids are coming tomorrow. I had a pretty good egg dish last night. What? What-what am I supposed to do with that information? Well, I don't know. Maybe ask me for the recipe? Do you have it? No. So what's going on with you guys? Nothing much. See, this is where Quagmire normally would have told one of his outrageous sex stories. Aw, we don't need him. I got a sex story for you. So I'm bangin' this chick, and she's sayin' to me, ""I'm worried that Chris won't get into college."" And then I says to her, ""Yeah, that seems like a legitimate concern."" And then I lost my wood, and so we just watched Colbert, and then I took a dump completely nude. Who else but Peter? Peter, face it-- without Quagmire, we're boring. Oh, come on, that ain't true. Yes, it is. He had all the fun ideas. Remember? He even took me parasailing. This is awesome! It's like I'm flying! (whooping) I've never felt so alive! Oh, if only I had a pair of legs. All right! (munching, gobbling) It was the fish part of me that wanted 'em! (munching, gobbling) (sighs) Look, Peter, I'm sorry Quagmire moved away, but you can't just sit around the house and drink all day. It's all your fault Quagmire fell in love with you. Traipsin' around in your tan pants and your green shirt and your soothing voice. My fault?! Yeah, everything is messed up. I lost my best friend, my buddies are all fighting, that chick at work is saying stuff that ain't true. Okay, you know what? Enough feeling sorry for yourself. We're fixing this now. Get in the car. What? Why? You'll see. Why should I trust you? You're always trickin' me into going places I don't want to. Oh you said we were going to a place Walt Disney built. No, Peter. I said supported. (bright fanfare playing)"
S14e7,LOIS:,"By the way, don't go on the train ride. I've been playing a game I invented called ""mini racquetball"" in your garage. Uh-huh. It's pretty fun. He has not won a single point. You don't have to win to have fun. (knocking on door) Lois? Peter. Zod. Hey. You're parked behind my trapezoid-thing. Yeah, yeah, I'll move it in a sec. Glenn, all this nonsense has to stop now. The only reason this became an issue is because Peter heard something he wasn't supposed to hear."
S14e7,CLEVELAND:,"Guy from Superman lives here?! And the truth is, we all have private thoughts we don't act on, and that's okay. For instance, every time I'm on the subway, I want to push a stranger onto the tracks. And that's fine! I don't do it! I guess you're right. I don't totally disagree with what Kim Jong-un's doing, but you don't see me moving there. I take medicine I get from the veterinarian. Is that one? No, no, it's not, but the point is, we all have secret thoughts. But there's no reason they should ruin our friendships. Sometimes I think about going to the hospital and switching the babies around. Somali pirates seem cool, too. I wouldn't mind eating the Phillie Phanatic. See? We're all terrible people inside. Joe's a little worse than the rest of us, but we all just shove our thoughts deep down, where they can't hurt anybody. Huh, maybe you're right. Of course I'm right. The secret to happiness is burying all your true feelings and living a life of bland compromise. So here's the question, Glenn. Do you love Peter enough to repress your love for me? Peter, if you're willing to forget all about this, I'm more than happy to continue hiding my true feelings. I do miss us hanging out together. Huh. Sorry I kind of went a little crazy. Ah, that's all right. And I'm sorry I will always love your wife. Which I don't. Thank you, Glenn. All right! What do you say we all celebrate with a game of mini racquetball? Wait. Is mini racquetball just Ping-Pong? Kind of. Boy, it's good to have the gang together again. Yeah, welcome home, buddy. Man, I missed sitting around, just shooting the breeze. Hey, so how'd you get your house back? This ought to be good. I suspended escrow. Oh. Hey, guys, you know that egg dish I was talking about? Turns out that was just a dream I had."
S15e1,ANNOUNCER:,"Final boarding call for Ashley's flight  to stuffy New England college. Final boarding.  Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa, child.  What's the hurry?  The love of my life, that's what.  We got a code Romeo.  Repeat, code Romeo.  If you get there on time,  there's an extra 50 in it for you.  I love this job!  I get knocked down, but I get up again   You're never gonna keep me down"
S15e1,CHRIS:,"Ashley, wait!  (panting)  I wouldn't miss this for all the rush hour fares in Bigtown.  Chris, you came. Oh, my God!  Let me get my grandma.  Chris?  Ashley. I love you.  (both grunting)  (groaning)  Oh, you're groaning at me?  You paid $19 to fly Spirit Air.  You get what you get.  All right, Brian, I've written a few songs,  all about stuff babies actually care about.  No more rainbows and unicorns.  Real baby issues.  Right, like heartworm and parvo?  No, baby stuff.  Oh, oh, human babies.  I didn't I didn't realize there was an agenda.  Okay, look, just pay attention.  Momma liked to party when you were in her belly   Drinking, she did some   Momma liked to party when you were in her belly   That's why you are dumb.   I call that ""Momma Liked to Party (Chris's Song)"".  Stewie, that's good. Hey, can I write one?  Yeah, we need as many as we can.  Our first gig is Saturday. It's a birthday party.  Wow, already?  How'd you book a gig so fast?  Easy. I figured out the perfect way  to get the word out to middle-aged moms.  Musical entertainment, available for parties.  Musical entertainment, available for parties.  Hey. Where you drinking that Chardonnay?  Oh, hey, Chris, how's the job hunt going?  Terrible. I can't find a job anywhere.  A lot of people seem to be turned off  by my dishonorable discharge.  What, from the Army?  No, it's a euphemism.  Oh, yucky.  Uh, you guys, I need help unloading the groceries.  My undiagnosed mom injury is flaring up.  These little things of applesauce  better not be for desserts."
S15e1,WOMAN:,"Go to hell, Glenn Quagmire!  I'm sorry, but Mondays are Asian only.  Why is your last name Wong?  It's my married name.  Now I see why you're here.  Geez, what was that about?  Ah, a little scheduling mix-up.  I am just so busy, I-I don't have any time  to organize my own life.  Wait a minute, what if you had someone  to help keep you organized? Chris is looking for work.  Maybe he can help you out, be your assistant.  Huh, maybe.  You have any references?  Uh, ""cowabunga,"" ""schwing,"" ""yada, yada, yada.""  Those are pretty good references.  You're hired.  (indistinct conversations)  Look at that. Look at the cake.  ""Happy Birthday Charlie and Uncle Craig.""  And Uncle Craig's written in a different color.  Oh, poor Uncle Craig.  Hey, is that your ex-girlfriend, Olivia?  God, what's she doing here?  She was always such a nightmare.  (children laughing)  Olivia?! Oh, my God, do I look okay?  I hate this shirt. Switch shirts. Switch shirts!  Stewie? Oh, I thought that was you.  Hey, Olivia, hey, what brings you here?  Oh, the birthday boy and I met  at Burt Reynolds' acting camp in Jupiter, Florida.  Well, I'm glad to hear you're still acting.  You know, the last time I saw you, you were  Burning in a cardboard house?  Yeah, burning in a cardboard house, yeah.  Uh, hey, listen, uh, I don't know if you've heard,  but we're the entertainment.  Aw, that's good. Good for you.  Okay, great to see you.  Come on, Stewie, it's not about her.  It's about those six children watching and the spazzy kid  who's just waiting for the snakes."
S15e1,BOY:,"Bring out the snakes!  It's a hot crowd, have fun out there.  I'm gonna go feed everything in my van to each other.  Okay, kids, if everyone's done washing their hands  from the snakes, we have some fun music for y  No climbing on the boat!  Okay, now please welcome Red Shirt Blue Shirt.  All right, we're Red Shirt Blue Shirt,  and here's a song we call ""Mommy and Daddy's Room.""  And we think it's one you can all relate to.  When everybody's gone to sleep   And you've said good night moon   There's plenty of noise still coming   From Mommy and Daddy's room   Oh, Daddy says ""please,"" Mommy says ""no""   Daddy says ""come on,"" Mommy says ""whoa""   Daddy goes (grunts), Mommy goes ""ow""   Daddy says ""I'm done,"" Mommy goes ""wow""   Daddy rolls over and falls asleep   Mommy drinks wine in the dark.   My God, did you hear 'em, Stewie? We're a hit.  We got to go out and celebrate.  Oh, he can't go out with you tonight.  He's got a date with me.  Really? Awesome.  Brian, I can't go. I'm not feeling well.  Stewie, I've been standing here the whole time.  But, you know-you know what, that's fine.  I'll just go have a dog-style celebration by myself.  Yeah!  Awesome time!  This is very fun for me!  - Hey! - Oh, hey!  - This is fun, right? - The best!  And me, too!  Great crowd, babe.  What are What is this?  Oh, Olivia's president of our fan club.  She's also doing half the band.  Do you even know what that means?  Uh, let's just say I couldn't toddle right for a week.  Okay, you don't.  All right, if you'll excuse me,  I have a poo poo diaper.  You really think this Olivia thing is a good idea?  Why wouldn't it be?  I don't know. It just seems like  it always ends badly for you two.  And it can be tricky working with an ex.  Look at Kermit and Miss Piggy.  How are you feeling, Miss Piggy?  I heard you called in sick yesterday.  Yeah, I had a frog in my throat.  (short laugh) Right, Kermie?  Eh? Right?  Please stop drinking.  Okay, Chris, I think you're gonna be a great assistant.  Your paperwork appears to be in order,  but before we get started, do you own  a pair of rubber boots that you'd have to wear  if you worked on a fishing boat?  Uh, no, I don't think so.  All right, I guess it'll be a light day today,  but tomorrow you should come wearing those.  Okay, got it.  Now, the first thing I need you to do every morning  is punch me in the stomach because I'm a bad person.  Is this a trick?  It's the furthest thing from a trick. Go ahead.  And it should be pretty hard,  I'm a worse person than you think.  (grunts) Okay, that's really good.  Now I need you to call Time Warner about my cable bill.  (indistinct conversations)  All right, this one is for all the mommies out there.  This is what we're really saying when we're crying.  Please put some butt paste on my button   Butt paste on my button   Smear it on my button for the fire down below   Oh, oh, oh, butt paste on my button   Butt paste on my button   Need it on my button 'cause it   Cools and quells me so.   Stay away, stay away   From the big kid in the baby swing.   There's a little metal box   At the top of the stairs   In the back of the closet   And a tiny little key   That's hidden in a book   In the drawer with the socks   And I know how to use it   To open up the box   And that's where the gun is.     You know, I talk a lot of smack, but at the end of the day,  these guys are pros.  Even Broken Arm Coyote with Washboard.  Hey, let's keep this party rolling.  I'll go get us another badly-scratched  plastic pitcher of soda.  Ugh, finally, he's doing something useful.  What? What do you mean?  Nothing. It's just, you write all the songs,  you've got a better voice, you've got the sweet bod  Oh, my God, babe.  Plus, you've got all the cool catchphrases like ""damn you all""  or ""what the dude"" or whatever.  Uh, it-it's ""deuce."" But, uh,  but yeah, you're-you're right, it I-I do.  Does it-does it sound through the mic  like I'm saying ""dude""? Should it be ""dude""?  Meanwhile, everyone thinks Brian is the star of the group.  Who thinks that?  I don't know. I'm just saying,  after every show, the fans are always petting Brian,  and not you.  No one's allowed to pet me. It's illegal.  I just hate to see Brian  getting all the attention that you deserve.  You should really watch your back.  Wow, it's hard to believe Brian would betray me.  I mean, he was there for me when I hit rock bottom.  See, Brian?  That's a rock bottom.  Thanks for being here for that.  Now get out of here, we're about to drink some Chardonnay.  Chris, could you please get Hannah a thank-you basket  and schedule her next appointment?  I'd like to see her again in two weeks.  Of course. Mr. Quagmire can fit in you  at 3:00 a week from Thursday.  That works.  And you know to fast the night before?  Yup.  And would you like to leave your panties in the fishbowl  for a chance to win a free lunch?  Good luck.  When you gonna do that drawing anyway?  Oh, there's no drawing, I just like smelling the bowl.  You know, you're doing a great job, Chris.  Why don't you jerk the rest of the day off.  Man, this is the best job ever.  And to think I almost took that pop-up restaurant gig.  - Hi, you hungry?! - Aah!  Check, check, Malia.  Check, Obama.  Check, check, check, Malia, Obama.  All right, that's a creepy mic check.  Let's just do a quick run-through of ""Little Brother.""  -  I want a little brother  - (humming the tune)  On second thought   I think I'd   Kill him dead.   Could-could we just cut Brian's mic?  His humming sounds like my table's ready at Chili's.  Stewie, what the hell is your problem?  I'll tell you what my problem is: I'm doing all the work  and you're just riding my coattails.  What are you talking about? I'm just as big a part  of this group as you are.  Oh, really? You're writing about  all your authentic baby experiences?  You asked me to do this with you.  Why you being such a dick?  Because I lost the baby!  What was that?  I don't know, he saw that in a movie or something.  Brian, this seems as good a time as any.  I think it's time to talk about your future with the band.  Are you serious?  You're actually kicking me out of the band?  Not at all. In fact,  I think you and I should kick Stewie out.  And I'll take his place.  - What? -"
S15e1,BOY:,"Bring out the snakes!  Does he just come to all of our shows?  So, you want to fire Stewie  and be Red Shirt Blue Shirt with me?  Absolutely.  You're the whole reason the fans even like the band.  Kids love dogs.  Besides, we've both seen what Stewie's become:  an impossible diva.  Yeah, but he's my friend.  Yeah, well, your friend  has been talking about kicking you out of the band.  Wait, what? He has?  And I don't know if you've considered this,  but the clock is ticking on Stewie's cuteness.  Huh. I guess you're right.  I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up  looking like an exact mash-up of Lois and Peter.  (giggles)  Groceries.  Hey. I had a thought about our costumes for today's show.  I could wear a shirt that's both red and blue,  and you can do spin art with all the wussy kids  who are afraid to go on rides.  Yeah? Well, how about this, Stewie?  - You're fired. - Pardon?  That's right. Olivia's taking your place in the band.  You are looking at the new Red Shirt Blue Shirt.  What the dude? Uhp, you know what, ""deuce"" was right.  Come on, Brian. You and I should probably rehearse.  We've got a show in 20 minutes.  Fine, go ahead! It's not gonna be the same!  Like Cheers wasn't the same when they brought in Kirstie Alley."
S15e1,ALL:,"Norm!  No, I'm-I'm Rebecca.  Meg, do you know how to use Microsoft Excel?  Yeah. I'm actually pretty good.  Yeah, you would. Dork.  But I do need to make that spreadsheet or I'm fired.  Oh, my God.  Peter, our dishwasher is full of sex toys.  Oh, yeah, Chris put those in there.  It's for his job. He's workin' for Quagmire now.  He's washing sex toys for Quagmire?  Not just that. He also takes pictures  of Quagmire's genitals to track sore growth.  So, brace yourself when you open iPhoto.  It's on the ""Griffin Family"" account.  Peter, my parents have access to that.  What's wrong with this worm?  And you knew about this?  How could you let him do this disgusting stuff?  What? You're the one who wanted Chris to get a job.  Yeah, like mowing lawns or trimming bushes.  Oh, he's doing one of those.  That's it.  I'm calling Quagmire right now and putting an end to this.  (line rings)"
S15e1,CHRIS:,"You have reached Glenn Quagmire.  Neither he nor his assistant is available.  To schedule a liaison, press one.  To cancel a liaison, press two.  If you're calling to report a pregnancy, please fill out  our online form, and we will mail you a check for $180.  Thank you, and have a giggity day.  (beep)  Chris, this is your mother.  Get these dildos out of the dishwasher.  (cheering, applause)  When everybody's gone to sleep   And you've said good night moon   There's plenty of noise still coming   From Mommy and Daddy's room   Oh, Daddy says ""please"", Mommy says ""no""   Daddy says ""come on"", Mommy says ""whoa""   Daddy goes (grunts), Mommy goes ""ow""   Daddy says ""I'm done"", Mommy goes ""wow""   STEWIE, BRIAN &"
S15e1,OLIVIA:,"Daddy rolls over and falls asleep   Mommy drinks wine in the dark.   (cheering, applause)  Thank you, Quahog.  That was great. They loved us.  Yeah, I guess, but did you see what I saw?  That kid with the cane?  Yeah, what do you think is wrong with him?  No, Stewie was out there.  - So? - So?  We're singing a song he wrote.  This whole thing was his idea.  Brian, don't mess this up.  We've got a good thing going.  I-I hate to tell you this, but I'm afraid  Red Shirt Blue Shirt is done.  I can't do this. I'm out.  I don't care. I don't need you.  I can get a hundred dogs to fit that stupid blue shirt.  You're a monster.  Like Frankenstein, when he became a loan officer.  So, I'm looking for money to open a small business.  We plan to sell antique lamps.  (intrigued grunt)  Handmade blankets.  (intrigued grunt)  And pitchforks.  (furious grunt)  Chris, there you are. We need to talk.  What, are you walkin' a horse?  Did Quagmire get a horse?  Oh no, here we go.  I want a horse!  Peter, it's not a horse.  Chris, what the hell is that?  Oh, this is Mr. Quagmire's horse gimp.  What is a ""horse gimp""?  It's a sexual fetishist who derives erotic pleasure  from dressing in horse-themed leather gear.  Want to see me feed him a carrot?  - Absolutely not. - Hell yes.  Chris, this is no job for a teenage boy.  You have to quit right now.  I can't quit. I'm actually good at this job.  Plus, I'm making decent money."
S15e1,MORT:,"You could work at the pharmacy.  Quiet, Triscuit!  Ooh, hook me to the plow!  Chris, I have $1,100 in a paint can in the garage.  Just take that, and we'll never speak of this again.  Okay.  Great. Now let's all go home.  Well, that's what I get for horsing around.  Ah, your joke wasn't funny enough.  (indistinct conversations)  Stewie?  Oh, hello, Brian.  I'm here to apologize.  And to let you know I quit the band.  You did?  Yes. It's nothing without you.  You were the band.  Those were your songs.  And I'm sorry if I let Olivia manipulate me.  (sighs) I guess she manipulated both of us.  There's just something about her flat chest and muscular legs.  Look, I never should've treated you the way I did.  I suppose I didn't treat you so well either.  So, what do you say? Can we put this all behind us  and go back to the way things were?  Of course we can.  Hey, I wonder if she's gonna keep the band going.  Probably. She told me  she was just gonna replace me with another dog.  Yes, but who?  I don't know. Probably some dog  neither you or I have ever met.  (cheering)  All right, listen up, you little pieces of garbage.  This song's about gettin' heartburn from baked clams.  And other kid stuff."
S15e2,PETER:,"They got blue!  And we all love the Italian food.  Oh, you like Italian food?  Want a meatball?  Yeah, I'm gonna pass on that, but it's a shame  we can't get good Italian food like this in Quahog.  Well, maybe the three of us ought to open  an Italian restaurant there.  Open our own Italian restaurant?  I say, that sounds fun.  You, uh, you keep meatballs in your jacket?  Oh, yeah, all my pockets are lined with Reynolds Wrap.  I learned that from my old buddies:  Dean Martin, Jr., Joey Bishop, Jr.,  and Sammy Davis the Third.  Hey, where's Chris?  He's over there playing that carnival game.  (ITALIAN ACCENT): Step right up!  Everybody take a chance on Whack-a-Big-a-Pussy!  (REPEATING RAPIDLY): Hey, Ton'!  This is not what I thought it was!  (YELLS)  Oh, my God, Chris is out of control!  I know!  It must be all the violence in movies and sex on TV.  Oh.  See, I listen. (CHUCKLES)  Peter, we need to talk about what happened  at the street fair.  Lois, it's an Italian festival.  You're supposed to yell ""Bella, Bella""  and grab as much fat ass as you can.  No, I'm talking about Chris.  I had no idea he had so much pent-up aggression.  We have to deal with his anger issues before he hurts himself.  Ah, that's good thinking, Lois.  I've seen what happens  when people hold in their aggression for too long.  Don't forget, I was in that elevator with Jay-Z.  Hey, could you have your guy hit ""two""?  I got to get down to the business center  to print out my boarding pass.  Oh! Hey! That's gonna leave a mark!  (CHUCKLES) That's from a movie.  So, you girls traveling with your dad here?  Hey, don't kick him, Muddy Shoes.  He's got a white suit on.  Hey, look, I don't know if you guys are really staying here,  but you can't get into the pool without a room key.  Okay, Chris, your mom and I want to help you  get out some of that aggression, so I thought you and me  could huck rotten apples at passing cars.  Oh, I didn't know we had brown apple in the forecast.  Welp, we needed it.  Wow, can I have a turn?  (TIRES SCREECHING)  Hey, which one of you threw that apple at my car?  He did it. He dragged me out here.  I wanted to be in school, sir.  Where'd you get a cannon like that, kid?  I work out my right arm three times a day.  Mm, Free weights?  No, mostly JPEGs of Helen Hunt on my hard drive.  Well, I'm Coach Doyle, and I head up the baseball team  at James Woods High.  What fake class do they also make you teach?  - Driver's ed, right? - No, wood shop.  Ah, that was my second guess.  Tell me, son, how would you like to pitch  for the high school team?  Baseball's the sport people play while eating, right?  Oh, yeah, sometimes I even watch a whole Blacklist.  I don't know, I've never played baseball before.  Oh, come on, Chris, you got to do it.  If you don't, you'll regret it.  Just like Jesus' friend, Evan, who bailed on the Last Supper.  Aw, they did a painting?  I would've gone if I knew they were gonna do a painting.  Here we are, fellas.  The future site of Quahog's newest Italian restaurant.  Wow, this is a great location.  Can we afford this?  Sure we can.  I set up one of those Kickstarters.  Then I realized how stupid that is  and I went to the bank for a loan like an adult.  Now, fellas, the tables should all be bolted to the floor  to prevent theft.  You know, most restaurants go out of business  because people are stealing the tables.  The toilets should also be bolted to the floor.  I think that's pretty standard, Frank, but okay.  Great. Now let's go find some chump's restaurant  and steal his tables and toilets.  James Woods is winning for now, but y'all never know  what might happen in the moments to come.  I mean, look, there's two baseball guys  out on the bases right now.  What if they's run to the scoring place?  BRUCE (OVER P.A.): Oh, here comes a new boy.  All right, Chris!  Wow, I've never seen him run onto a baseball field  when he wasn't chasing a duck or being chased by a duck.  That a duck over there?  Ah, come on!  What the hell's Coach Doyle thinking  bringing in that fat slob?!  You know what?  I bet you a hundred bucks that ""fat slob"" strikes this kid out.  Ha, you're on.  Strike one!  (CROWD MURMURING)  Strike two!  BRUCE (OVER P.A.): Ooh!  (EXHALES)  Strike three!  (CHEERING)  BRUCE (OVER P.A.): Three strikes and he's out,  just like my cousin Freddie with the drugs.  Holy crap, a hundred bucks!  Hey, nice going, Chris!  Wow, look how proud my dad is.  Oh, my God, a duck!  It was a trap!  (LOUD QUACKING)  Guys, tonight the drinks are on me.  I just won a hundred bucks off Chris's baseball game.  Really? How'd you do that?  This dad took one look at Chris and thought he'd suck,  but it turns out Chris is a great pitcher.  I'm so proud of the money I won betting on him.  You know, I bet there are plenty of other baseball dads  who'd also assume Chris stinks.  Peter, we could make a lot of money.  Yeah, we could make Toni Braxton money.  Is that is that a lot?  It's a lot, and then nothing.  And then a record whose proceeds go directly to creditors.  (""CENTERFIELD"" BY JOHN FOGERTY PLAYING)  Put me in, Coach   I'm ready to play   Today   Put me in, Coach   I'm ready to play   Today   Look at me   I can be   Centerfield   Well, I spent some time in the Mudville Nine   Watching it from the bench   You know I took some lumps   When the Mighty Casey struck out   So Say Hey Willie   Tell the Cobb   And Joe DiMaggio   Don't say it ain't so   You know the time is now.   Frank, where the hell is everybody?  This was supposed to be our big opening night.  I'll tell you what the problem is.  Every successful restaurant has a hook or a gimmick.  That's what we're lacking.  (GASPS) No, we're not.  Frank, you're the hook! That's right.  We just need to make you the face of the restaurant.  It may be the five loaves of garlic bread  I ate this morning talking, but I think that's a swell idea.  (TUNE OF ""I WISH I WERE IN LOVE AGAIN"" PLAYING)  You'll love the meal   The fancy feel   The showbiz stories while you eat your veal   It's family dining with a mobster feel   At Frank Sinatra's restaurant   Junior!

(MUSIC ENDS)  (CHUCKLES) Wow!  Look at this, guys.  I can't believe we made all this in one game.  Yeah, I'm having a great time  handling this money and then touching my eyeball.  Jerome, another round for my blurry friends.  Yeah, we got a good thing going.  We just have to keep Chris's talent a secret.  TOM TUCKER (OVER TV): Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.  Our top story tonight, the James Woods High baseball team  is headed to the district championship,  thanks to their secret weapon, star pitcher Chris Griffin.  Ah, crap, now everyone knows Chris is a ringer!  Tom Tucker just ruined everything.  This sucks even worse than when I stubbed my toe.  Aah!  Why does everything bad always happen to me?!  Answer me, guy in box and guy on cross!  (LOUNGE MUSIC PLAYING)  (INDISTINCT CHATTER)  Stewie, can I talk to you?  Look, Brian, I affectionately pat all the waiters on the ass.  And if anyone has a problem with it,  they should come to me directly!  No, no, it's not that.  I-I've been going through our receipts,  and we're actually losing money.  Well, yeah, duh.  Frank comps every meal.  Look, he's doing it again.  Little-known secret about Charlton Heston.  Never used toilet paper.  Just drop and go.  Uh, here, let me get that check for you.  (SIGHS)  Well, it's official.  Nobody wants to bet against Chris now.  Damn it! I can't believe my kid  isn't making money for us anymore.  I feel like Jessica Simpson's dad.  Well, there are plenty of guys willing to bet  on James Woods High to win, I'll tell you that.  The only way we could ever make money now is if Chris lost.  Wait a minute, Joe, that's it!  All we got to do is take those bets  and get Chris to take a dive!  Wait, hold on, Peter.  You're gonna ask your own son to lose on purpose?  Damn, Quagmire!  Your fridge gives you water from the door?  Hey, champ, what you doing?  My Spanish homework.  Oh, well, then maybe I'll just say this to you in Spanish.                Chris, what the hell are you doing?!  Calm down. This is how they package Snapple now.  They're trying to trick kids into drinking it.  You may not believe this,  but there was a time when Snapple ruled the nation.  Preposterous!  It's true. Even Jerry Seinfeld drank it.  And he was the president of the '90s.  But why are you so down?  Dad told me I have to lose the championship game on purpose.  He what?!  Peter, get in here right now!  Wow, someone's day-horny!  Oh, hey, Chris.  Did you tell Chris he had to lose  the district championship?!  Let me just get a garbage bag. Hold on.  Okay, now that I'm decent.  Yes, I did tell Chris to throw the game.  But it's okay; it's for gambling.  What?! You're betting on Chris's baseball team?!  Technically against Chris's baseball team.  Are you crazy?!  Do I look crazy?!  What do you think puts the food on our table  and the garbage bags on our backs?!  Chris, your father's a jackass.  When you get on that field,  you try your very best and play to win.  You understand me?  Yeah. Thanks, Mom.  But, Lois, if Chris wins that game,  I'll be out a ton of money and I'll have to kiss a fella!  I take all kinds of bets.  Hey, Frank, we have to talk.  You've got to stop giving away all the food for free.  Yeah, otherwise there's no way we're gonna make a profit.  Oh, we don't have to worry about money.  I might be doing a Duets thing with that Lady Goo-Ga.  Uh-huh, that's wrong.  Anyway, the restaurant's gonna go under  if you keep giving away food.  All right, all right.  Thank you, Frank.  I appreciate you trying it my way.  Thank you.  What was that?  Oh, I get 40 bucks  every time somebody says ""my way.""  Nancy gets 60.  What do you mean Chris won't take a dive?!  We already took a ton of bets!  Look, I'm sorry, you guys,  but my hot piece-of-ass wife says no way.  It's a weird time to brag about your wife, Peter.  I don't know, I've just been so horny today.  Oh, man, I don't need to know that!  Well, pull it together, Peter,  'cause we're about to lose a lot of money!  (SIGHS) I know.  We're screwed once Chris takes the mound  with that awesome arm of his.  Wait, so what you're saying is Chris isn't the problem,  his arm is.  I guess.  Okay. We hear you, Peter.  Loud and clear.  Yeah, we'll fix this problem.  You guys are creeping me out.  All right, I'm gonna exit while discreetly  checking out the hot chick by the door.  You guys heard what I heard, right?  Peter just asked us to break Chris's arm.  Well, he intimated.  I don't know what that means,  but let's go rough up a teenager for beer money!  Oh, I call biting!  Okay, there's the baseball team's locker room right there.  Perfect! And we look like regular high school students,  so we'll fit right in.  Joe, are you sure about these clothes?  Trust me. I bought the absolute latest issue of Archie comics,  and this is what the kids are wearing.  Oh, hey, fellow teens.  Wait a minute, teenagers don't have wheelchairs!  (SOBBING): No! Oh, no!  (INDISTINCT CHATTER)  Okay, guys, we've served our last free meal.  Here I go with the check.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Last time we ate here,  Mr. Sinatra's son said it was free.  Okay, uh, everyone, new policy!  As is the case with many restaurants,  you're going to have to pay for your food.  What? This food ain't worth paying for.  Yeah, the only reason we eat here is 'cause it's free.  Look whose restaurant thinks it's so good!  Oh, yeah? If it was Joey's restaurant, you would've paid.  (CRYING)  Ma!  I'm sorry, Ma!  Ma!  I can't believe it.  They hated us.  Well, fellas, we gave it our best shot.  If you need me, I'll be back in Palm Springs,  which has been completely taken over by the gays.  So, want to grab whatever wine is left  and then burn the place down?  Maybe, but first, let's have an unearned  end-of-the-series moment where we turn out the lights  on our own place.  Sorry, pal, we're closed.  (PIANO PLAYING SOMBER MUSIC)  Peter, we've got great news!  Chris isn't playing!  He's not? Why?  Well, 'cause we broke his arm like you told us to.  Shattered. We shattered his arm.  You what?! I never told you to do that!  You didn't? That's what I thought I heard.  Quagmire, this is humbling, but it may be time  for all of us to talk about hearing aids.  I feel terrible! I got to go find my son!  Chris!  Dad, my arm's broke! And look, a Camaro!  Oh, that guy must be so boss.  But listen, Chris, I had no idea this was gonna happen.  Look, I was wrong to bet on your games,  and it's even worse that I told you to lose.  I'm so sorry.  Oh, that's okay, Dad.  I just feel bad that my arm is broken  in so many places and hurts so much.  No, Chris, I've been a terrible dad lately.  You found something you were great at,  and instead of being happy for you,  I tried to use it to make money.  And now your arm is broken and your baseball career is over.  Not necessarily.  What? What are you talking about?  Well, for the last few weeks, since my right arm's  been exhausted from pitching, my left arm's had to, uh,  pick up the slack in the bathroom.  (TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING)  (CROWD CHEERING)  You see the pitcher?  That's my kid.  Aah! Son of a bitch!"
S15e2,CHRIS:,"Oh, my God!  Sorry, Mr. Quagmire!  I heard that bone break.  My ears are fine.  Well, Chris, we're very proud of you  for making it to the district championship.  Thanks, Mom.  It was really something, Lois.  The next pitch Chris threw hit his coach in the head,  so there was no one to take him out of the game.  Chris walked the next 46 batters.  State record.  Wow, Chris! State record!  Yeah, they got crushed.  But at least I didn't have to pay out  all those bets and kiss a guy.  But I saw you kissing the driver of that Camaro.  That that-that was something else.  (WEAKLY): Baseball!"
S15e3,PILOTS:,"Fair wages!  When do we want it?  Originally now, but it's been delayed until 9:40  due to weather in Philly!  (SIGHS) This is a mess.  Like when Peter rode that Access Hollywood bus.

What a day.  Please don't comment.  Oh, look at you.  - Did you get a job? - Bitch.  Did I get a job?  Um, this ain't a life-vest, sista.  It's a work vest from a little place called Mega Hardware.  'Cause that's basically what I am now.  Just an everyday, working-class Joe.  Well, good for you.  No. No, Brian.  This doesn't feel right today.  Yes.  There's a rat trap in that cabinet.  With a foot in it.  And somewhere in this house, there's a footless rat.  Well, I'm off to watch some Fox News  in front of the old boob tube.  Tommy used to work on the docks   Union's been on strike   He's down on his luck   It's tough, so tough.   - Hey. - No.  - I wasn't sure. - I'm sure.  - Okay. - Well, got to go.  Got to do some more picketing.  Seriously? It's, like, 9:00 at night.  Yeah, uh well, it's, uh  Cleveland's stealing shot glasses!  I don't like drinking NyQuil out of them little cups.  Where the hell's Quagmire going?  The airport's that way.  He doesn't know we're following him, Joe.  You don't have to duck down.  I'm not. You took a pretty hard right turn back there.  I've been like this for a while.  (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING INSIDE)  What's he doing?  This is one of them places  where women go to see male strippers.  Some bisexual men go as well.  (DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES)  I don't see him.  Ladies, this is your pilot speaking.  I am in the full, upright and locked position.  (WOMEN CHEERING)  Oh, my.  (MUSIC STOPS)  Oh, my God! What are you guys doing here?!"
S15e3,PETER:,"Crap. Our disguises didn't work.  Quagmire, I didn't know you were a male stripper.  I wasn't. Not until the strike, anyway.  I've been out of work for three weeks.  I'm out of money. I-I had to do something.  God, I'm so embarrassed.  Why? Stripping is a very respectable profession.  If it weren't respectable,  why would real estate agents go to strip clubs for lunch?  He's right. This is tremendous.  Are you banging all these chicks?  Hey, hey! That is offensive.  I am a dancer, not a gigolo!  Captain Cockpit, my friend is about to get married,  and we were wondering if you'd have sex with her for $500.  I'm a gigolo.  Oh, hey, it's that guy.  Are you gonna say, ""Who else but Quagmire?""  (CLEARS THROAT) N uh, no, I, uh, uh,  w-wanted to know if Quagmire  was available tomorrow evening?  Are are you gay?  Uh, of course not. No.  Uh, but I'm unable to properly  have sex with my wife, so I figured, you know.  Eh, who else but Quagmire?  Hey, awesome cameo.  Hey, sorry I'm late, guys.  Had to stop at the dry cleaner.  The dry cleaner?  Wow, somebody struck it rich.  You know, I got to tell you,  I was sweating that pilot strike,  but now that I'm a gigolo, I'm making money by the fistful.  Is that a giggity?  That is a giggity.  Hey, Quagmire, I couldn't help but notice  you got some dry cleaning hanging up  in the backseat of your car.  - Did you win the lottery? - No.  Well, I hope you're not actually doing that gigolo thing.  You know, prostitution is illegal.  Uh, uh, no, no, no. It's, uh, it's something else.  Uh, uh, Quagmire's, uh,  selling online Internet cyber stuff.  Wow. Good for you, Quagmire.

Do you have a small grocery cart  I could put this boat-sized hunk of lumber in?  Probably out in the parking lot.  Can you tell me where I can find extension cords?  - Aisle 25. - I was just there.  - 26. - There is no 26.   So Goby gets up on the lift  Don't mind me.  Just grabbing myself a cup of mud.

One of my tricks drove me here from the Clam,  and I didn't have any money for a cab.  Why not? Didn't she just pay you for sex?  No. After it was over, she said she wasn't gonna pay.  Well, that ain't fair.  You can't let these women take advantage of you like that.  What apartment is she in? I'll go talk to her.  She's in unit 17.  You know, if you're going back in anyway,  can you grab my belt?  It's reversible, so I'd hate to lose it."

Wow, thanks!  No problem. It's just too bad you're not here every time.  Well, I could be.  I mean, my days are pretty open,  and I don't sleep a lot at night 'cause of health stuff.  Huh. That'd be kind of nice, actually.  Hey, maybe you could drive me around and help me out,  and I could even pay you a little something for your time.  Sure, that sounds great. And you know what?  It'll be nice having a little extra cash  to bet on college football.  Yeah, I'd like to bet a hundred bucks.  You want to pick a team?  No, just take it.  I thought you had the day off.  Maybe from the store, but it's not like things  take a day off from needing repairs, am I right? (CHUCKLES)  Oh, looks like this cabinet door is a good place to start.  Yup, she's off-kilter.  I'm gonna have to plane her down.  Lois, what year was this house built?  Uh, I don't know. Maybe 1945?  Good, it's grandfathered in. Thought I'd need a variance.  Don't want to get a code vi.  (CHUCKLES) ""Vi"" is violation.  ""Code"" is just code.  I don't know, Brian, it looks straight to me.  - What? - It's straight.  I-I don't know what that means. ""It's-it's straight""?  Oh, you mean plumb.  Y-You're saying the door is plumb.  Wow, Brian, you do know all the lingo.  Ah, come on, that's just stuff you pick up on the site.  I'm gonna go use a miter to jerry-rig a shim jamb  strap hinge quarter-round soffit  two-by-six dowel cherry-picker flim-flam.  You know, Rupert, Brian's douche-iness  should infuriate me, but the truth is he seems happy.  So I guess I'll just do nothing and that's that.  (THEME SONG PLAYING)  Can't do it.

But I like your effort, Luis.  Uh, any other ideas?  You could kill a guy.  You know what, Carlos, you stay quiet for a while.  I really only need two of you.  You'll still be paid.  You ask for papers?  Okay, is there any idea out there besides killing a guy  or getting someone deported?  We do good job, we live with you?

(SIGHS) All right, everybody, take five.  Okay, I'll be in my dressing room playing online poker.  That's me asking for help.  Hi, I'm James Woods.  You might know me from banging your niece  on a pile of your brother's pool equipment.  Or from Salvador.  But tonight, I'm here to take you  behind the scenes on the set of Family Guy.  For the first time ever, you'll see what a typical  production week is like for TV's 11th favorite family.  So please join me as we go  Inside Family Guy.    (INSTRUMENTAL FAMILY GUY THEME SONG PLAYS)  It's certainly not easy being a family  that also happens to star in a sitcom together.  Especially last year, when I discovered  those naked pictures of that 18-year-old intern  on Peter's phone.  But he explained that his phone number  was the old number of-of her ex-boyfriend,  so what was it again?  Oh, the Cloud, that's right.  So the photos were on the Cloud,  and that the-the Cloud pulled the pictures or?  I mean, even if the pictures had not been sent directly to him,  and that's why he has them.  And-and we both called the Apple store,  and they said they can't disprove that it doesn't happen,  so here we are, still married, still on the show.  A-And it's happened five times since then,  and some of the pictures had both Peter and the girl in them.  Being on this show reminds me  of one of my favorite quotes from Macbeth."
S15e4,WOODS:,"What's the quote?  (CHUCKLES) Whoa!  I didn't realize this was a trial.  Objection, Your Honor.  Oh, yeah, it's great, you know, doing a show with your family.  'Cause what guy doesn't want to go to his office  and have his family there?  You know, and then you go home after work  and catch up with the family.  - And then, uh, - next day, same thing.  Just trying to make it to the weekend, so you can, uh  spend some time with the family.  Isn't that the dream?"
S15e4,WOODS:,"Now, I-I understand the show  was quite different when it started.  Yeah, in the original pilot, I was actually the star.  It was called, CHRIS"
S15e4,GRIFFIN:,"Teen Doctor.  Sir, I'm afraid I've got some bad news.  Well, it can't be any worse than what's in here.  (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHTER)  I ad-libbed that line.  I wasn't even supposed to talk.  What they didn't know is that I'd been privately  doing jokes about the newspaper for years.  But, you know, it's not just the Griffins  who work hard to make Family Guy what it is.  Here in the props department,  some sweaty guy is working on the Petercopter.  That's right.  You know, a lot of people don't realize SEAL Team Six  actually completed their mission in this puppy.  Oh, cool, Family Guy!  Over here! I'm down here!  Knock-knock?  Yeah? Hi, Stewie.  Hey, I was just showing the viewers around Family Guy,  and we thought we'd drop in and talk to you about the show.  You want to talk about the show?  I'll talk about the show. The show sucks.  The only reason I stay here is to maintain my profile  for my start-up business, DiscreetCrepe.com.  Hi. Are you a straight, adult male who likes  to eat crepes without people making unwanted assumptions  about your private life?  Go to DiscreetCrepe.com,  place your order, and within 30 minutes  (DOORBELL RINGS)  Very masculine pizza delivery for Stewie Griffin?  Oh, thank you.  Mmm, strawberry-banana Nutella with raspberry drizzle!  Now I just need a guy's butt to eat this off of,  and I got myself a night.  But of course, every episode of Family Guy  starts with the writing.  And here we are the Family Guy writers' room  where the writers are hard at work  with the show's talented cast.  Look, don't get me wrong, guys, I-I think it's hilarious,  and-and I totally get that the sex thing  is what made me popular, but would it kill us  to just once tell a joke that brings glory to God?  Eight years ago, Glenn opened a restaurant where he was  spying on ladies peeing in the bathroom.  As part of the class-action settlement,  he entered rehab, and that's where he found Jesus.  The restaurant was called Sprinklers.  That should've been a tip-off.  He still runs Dumpy's, but I'm pretty sure that one's legit."
S15e4,WOODS:,"As the star of the show,  Peter likes to stay involved in the writing process.  All right, butthorns,  which one of you idiots wrote this script?  Uh, I did.  Oh, what'd you write it, like, on a computer?  Yeah.  So you know a lot about computers?  Yeah.  Can you show me how to turn off the flashlight on my phone?  (BEEPS) Don't touch my phone!  And another thing, I read this piece of garbage script.  It's only one page.  That's never gonna cut it.  Uh, that's just the cover.  You can turn the page, like this.  Well, why you hiding all these pages behind the first page?!  What's wrong with them?!  Stand by your work or get out!  Now, spit in each other's mouths.  (WRITERS SPITTING)  You know I'm only tough on you 'cause I hate you, right?  Yeah, over the years, Peter's become just a total nightmare.  I mean, you know, he's not Jim Belushi.  He's not peeing in Snapple bottles on set,  which is, like, a totally real thing.  But he-he's-he's pretty bad.  Dad refuses to interact with any actors on set.  He'll only rehearse with helium balloons  with crudely drawn faces on them.  I'm sorry, Meg, but you're grounded."
S15e4,MEG:,"But, Dad, the prom is tonight. Over.  (STATIC CRACKLES)"
S15e4,LOIS:,"You heard your father, Meg. Over.  (STATIC CRACKLES) (KNOCKING)"
S15e4,JOE:,"Peter, you ready to hit the Drunken Clam?  Over. (STATIC CRACKLES)  It's difficult having to give up my chair for the balloon.  But that's the business we call ""show.""  Excuse me, Joe.  The Fat Man's behavior has been deteriorating  for quite some time.  And I think someone may have  placed an anonymous phone call to the network about it.  STEWIE (FALSETTO):  Word around the stage is they've decided to finally fire Peter  and replace him with another actor.  And this time, it's permanent.  Not like when we killed off Brian for a few episodes,  so he could shoot that crappy movie what was it?  It was a remake of Old Yeller where the dog  gets the drop on him and kills him first.  I'm sorry.  No, I'm sorry.  (GRUNTING)  They miscalculated the number of dogs who buy movie tickets.  It's actually pretty awkward.  I mean, Dad's the only one in the whole production  who doesn't know he's being fired.  But he'll find out tomorrow at the table read.  This is how we did that.  Bet you didn't know.  (LOW, INDISTINCT CHATTER)  The table read is where the Family Guy cast reads aloud  that week's script to see how the story  and the jokes are working.  And where Peter will learn he's being written off the show.  Okay, everybody, welcome to the table read for this week's  episode, entitled, ""Peter Dies (We're Really Serious, No Joke,  He's Dead and Never Coming Back).""  Oh, and there's other pages. You got to turn them.  Here, let me show you.  ""Interior, Griffins' living room, day.  ""Brian, Meg and Chris watch TV.  Lois enters, upset.""  You guys, I have terrible news!  Your father is dead.  He was shot in the head while killing himself.  I suppose he had his demons.  And his enemies.  Wait, I'm I'm what?  Oh-oh, I know.  Stewie's gonna fire up his time machine and undo this."
S15e4,DIRECTOR:,"""Stewie enters.""  Brian, bad news.  My time machine got a virus  that causes Dad to die again if it's ever used.  Oh, wait, you know what?  I-I bet this is all Chris' dream.  Wow, I am wide awake!  Okay, but there's no way this is real.  They'd have to bring in someone to replace me.  ""Uncle Ricky, played by sitcom buzzard  David Spade, enters.""  Hi, everybody."
S15e4,ALL:,"Uncle Ricky!  Hey guys, a time period called.  They want an object back.  (LAUGHTER)  Aw, do we have to go to Dad's funeral?  Let's just play with Uncle Ricky instead.  ""The family cheers.  They do not miss Peter.""  I'm sorry, Peter, but the production  just can't deal with all your nonsense anymore.  We're letting you go.  Oh, please, don't do this!  I'm begging you, just give me one more chance!  (SIGHS) Okay, fine.  (BLEEP)  All right, that's it, you're fired!  And you guys are all okay with this?!  I'm sorry, sweetheart.  This is painful for all of us,  but we just don't see another option.  Yeah, Peter, we love you,  and-and you're still part of the family,  just not part of the show.  Look, I don't know who brought this on,  but maybe it's for the best.  All right, fine, you bastards can fire me,  but at least I'm leaving with my dignity.    Have a good life, Mr. G.  Your penis is out.  Welcome back to Inside Family Guy.  I'm your host and angel investor to the Fappening,  James Woods.  Boy, we picked quite a week to document  the production of a Family Guy episode.  Yesterday, Peter Griffin was fired from the show  and replaced by David Spade.  Given this surprising development,  we decided to follow Peter, and see if our cameras  could capture his story, as well.  We caught up with Peter at Hollywood's legendary  Chateau Marmont Hotel, where I once engaged  in the consensual murder of an underaged prostitute."
S15e4,WOODS:,"So, what's your plan?  Are you going to be staying here for awhile?  Yeah, well, I figured if my family doesn't want me  on the show, there's no reason I should keep living with them.  I-I mean, there's no hard feelings, um, I just feel like  this is best for me, and this is best for those cancerous dicks.  And what's next for Peter Griffin?  Well, starting tomorrow, I'm getting back out there.  I already got an audition to be the caring dad  for a Cheerios commercial.  Hey, Dad?  Yeah, bud?  When you were a kid,  what did you want to be when you grew up?  Well, I wanted to be a rock star.  Why didn't you become one?  'Cause of you, bud.  I smiled at one girl in a cell phone store,  and now here I am, stuck eating cereal  for dinner with a kid.  You'll always be a rock star to me, Dad.  You ruined my life.  I'm going to bed.  (FUNKY BASS MUSIC PLAYS)  Wednesdays are rehearsal days here at Family Guy  and the first rehearsal with David Spade  appears to be going very well.  ""Uncle Ricky,  what are all these strippers doing in our house?""  ""Uh each other?""  Hmm?  (LAUGHS)  Oh, my God!  (LAUGHING): I'm sorry, I just  (LAUGHS)  Did you see the way he smirked?  He's like a naughty 53-year-old boy.  Who is this guy?  I'm not familiar with him.  That's David Spade from Just Shoot Me!  I don't know that one.  He was in Grown Ups, Joe Dirt,  Saturday Night Live.  Saturday what how?  And he was also in some movie called Senseless.  With Marlon Wayans?  Oh, yeah, he played Scott Thorpe.  Donna, I'm here with Scott Thorpe.  That's right, from Senseless.  Yeah, I got to be honest, I'm having a blast.  You know, now that I'm not tied down by the show,  it's given me more time to pursue my true passion:  weaving sexually explicit tapestries  featuring the Minions.  Did you have any questions about the artist?  Thursdays at Family Guy are reserved for shooting  all those flashbacks and cutaway gags we love so much,  and what most people don't know  is that all these gags are directed by James Cameron.  What's that?  I'm sorry. (CHUCKLES)  Apparently, I misread the cue card.  They're directed by James, the cameraman.  Tell us, how'd you get the gig?  I sell Vicodin to some of the producers.  What a wonderful Hollywood story.  You know, many viewers think our cutaways  are just whipped together, but they actually  go through a rigorous testing process before filming.  This is the planet Jew-piter,  and he could say, ""Next year is my star mitzvah.""  (LAUGHS)  They love it.  Tell the director. Where is he?  It says don't take it with alcohol,  but you should take it with alcohol.  Yeah, duh.  I also need a couple for the girl I'm babysitting.  Meanwhile, David Spade is making lots of friends on set.  Yeah, I'll definitely talk to the writers.  I agree, there's a lot about your character  that's still untapped.  Okay, thank you, because,  like, yes, I'm greased-up  and, yes, I'm deaf, but what else am I?  Totally.  Thanks, man."
S15e4,DIRECTOR:,"Okay, we're ready for you.  (HIGH-PITCHED VOICE): I'll be right there.  Who's the new kid?  Hot-chee-wawa!  Unfortunately, things aren't going quite so well for Peter.  (PHONE RINGS)  Yeah, it's an '09, fully loaded, extra cool A/C.  Great.  I just made $500 flipping a Honda.  All I did was Armor-All the dash.  Boom.  (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)  Hey, any mail for me?  Yes, your death threats to Grimace  have all been returned.  Well, has the Shamrock Shake period been extended?  I believe that's still seasonal,  but while I have you, your bill remains unpaid,  and we saw you selling our robes on eBay.  I'm afraid we're evicting you from the hotel.  What's your home address?  I'm sorry, sir.  Now do you want to leave the regular way,  or do you want our Uncle Phil to throw you out?  I think you know what I want.  (SHOUTS)  (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHTER)  (DISTANT SIREN WAILING)  (HINGES CREAKING)  Door was unlocked.  I'm sure that's fine.  Well, this seems like a really cheery place,  and looks like some guy named Brooks was here,  and I think this is gonna work out just great."
S15e4,WOODS:,"You don't miss your show or your family at all?  Of course I miss my family  but everything comes to an end eventually, a-and you just  you just got to keep moving forward.  Are you gonna be all right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I-in fact, I was just about to melt some cheese on chips  if you want to stay for a sad, single guy dinner.  You going oven or microwave?  Uh, microwave.  I don't know how to turn on the oven.  Those, uh, chips are gonna be chewy, Peter.  Friday night is tape night here at Family Guy,  but tonight they'll be filming the show without Peter Griffin.  I have to admit, it's a little strange  taping a show without Peter.  It-it just doesn't feel right.  I'm especially going to miss the Fat Man's bit  with the audience where he fires  the T-shirt cannon at his own head.  You know he once tried to hold up a store with that thing?  (BELL JINGLES) All right, everybody on the floor.  Empty the register.  Please, don't do this!  Oh, yeah?  You want to be a hero?  Here's what happens to heroes.  Anybody else want to be a hero?  Ooh, me, me, me!  Over here! Over here!  And with regard to Peter's replacement, well,  as his parents and previous co-stars have learned,  a little of David Spade goes a long way.  David, the line is, ""What's for dinner?""  Go again.  What's for dinner?  Hmm?  (SIGHS)  Okay, we can trim that in editing.  He's getting on people's nerves.  I mean, there's only so many jars I can open for one man."
S15e4,DAVID:,"Lois, I want pickles!  Coming!  He has tiny hands but when one of my rings  went down the drain, he got it right out."
S15e4,WOODS:,"Meanwhile, Peter has wound up  here at the Chinese Theatre, where panhandlers  dress up like iconic movie characters  and charge tourists for photos.  It's even seedier than it sounds.  Step right up, get your picture taken  with beloved comic icon, Little Lotta.  Just two dollars.  Who are you?  Uh, Little Lotta?  She was friends with Audrey and Dot.  Never heard of her.  (GROANS)  (EXCITED CHATTERING, CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)  That's it. Screw this.  I am taking back my TV show and my family.  Ah, we just missed her.  Hey, Smitty, I'm here to get my show back.  I'm sorry, Mr. Griffin, but we have specific orders  not to let you onto the lot.  Seriously?  Well, I suppose, you could come inside  if you had an idea for a show  the heads of the network wanted to buy.  Bumblr with a Tumblr.  So, you see, he's got  a Tumblr account and he's clumsy.  We really like the idea that the words rhyme.  Absolutely, but just a thought:  what if he doesn't bumble?  Um I-I guess so.  And are we married to the Tumblr account?  They bought the pitch, but, um, after a series of network notes,  Bumblr with a Tumblr eventually aired as Bamblr with a Famblr,  which made sense to nobody and is now in its third season.  It did also get me on the lot.  All right, stop the show!  Dad!  That's right, I'm back!  And, Chris, I brought you a T-shirt of Kermit the Frog  acting like a hip-hop guy.  That's so dope.  Don't put it on. It'll fall apart,  but listen, everybody, I realized something.  I've been a real jerk to you guys, and to all  the union fat asses that I assume do something  to keep this thing going.  The fact is, I got too big for my britches,  but I know now that I'm nothing without all of you.  Aw, that's nice of you to say.  Thank you, Stewie, who I can understand,  and if you guys can find it in your hearts to take me back,  well, then I promise that every day I'll prove to you  how much the show, and how much my family, means to me.  Oh, Peter.  Of course we'll take you back.  Oh, welcome back, buddy.  We missed you so much.  My online poker problem is burning like a wildfire.  Well, there's only one problem.  What's that?  What are we gonna do about David Spade?  Don't worry, I already took care of that.  I got SofÃ­a Vergara deported.  Hey, everyone, cuchi, cuchi.  I'm your mother now.  So, all right, let's do a show.  Oh, wait, if my character's still alive,  that means we don't have a script to shoot.  Oh, look at this.  We just happen to have  a whole extra script right here.  ""Pete, Don't Fail Me Now.""  (GASPS)  Sounds like I might be a teacher.  Oh, I have a goatee up till the first commercial,  and then I'm a teacher.  Every week, Peter becomes a diva  so the writers write a fake script, killing him off.  He storms out, then by Friday's taping,  comes crawling back, and we shoot the real script.  Of course, he always forgets by Monday,  and then he becomes a pain in the ass again.  Does it bother me that he does this every week?  Uh, why don't you ask my Camaro?"
S15e4,WOODS:,"So, I guess this actually was a very typical week  on the set of Family Guy.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm James Woods, and we'll close tonight with a supercut  of every time in the show's history that Peter got hit  in the crotch with a bag of nickels.  Ow!  (GRUNTS)  (GROANS)  Damn it.  Oh!  (ALL LAUGHING)  Why?!  Hey, Lois, you should do  that thing that I like (SHOUTS)  Hey, kids, have you seen my wallet?  Oh, nickels!  Son of a bitch!"
S15e4,PETER:,"Uh, ladies and gentlemen,  we have now reached our cruising  Ah, damn it!  Boy, can't beat this weather  (SHOUTS) Who is that kid?  (GRUNTS)  Hello?  Uh, hang on, I'll check.  Phone call for ""a bag of nickels""?  (SHOUTS)  (GROANS)  At least he was alone.  They usually travel in threes.  Ow! Crap.  B-B-B-Bird, bird, bird, b-b-b-bird   Ah, nickels!  (SHOUTS)  (GROANS)  Oh, damn it!  Do you think I'm ever gonna be able to have  (GRUNTS) (LAUGHS)  Ow!"
S15e5,ALL:,"Three, two, one!  Some animals give me boners!  (BALLOON POPS, ""AULD LANG SYNE"" PLAYING)  Hi. Uh, I'd like to be an Uber driver.  Okay, sure. Welcome aboard.  Don't I don't I need to fill out a form or?  Oh, right, yeah, of course.  ""Name.""  Peter Griffin.  ""Criminal history.""  This section is optional. I will skip this.  And done.  Here you go. Yeah, none of this really matters.  All I need to know is: do you have a car,  a phone and a face?  It's my dog's car.  Oh, and I know you didn't ask,  - but I am quick to anger. - Okay, great.  Now get out there and try to kiss as many ladies as you can.  The record is 60 in a month.  You, sir, are officially an Uber driver.  (BLUETOOTH RINGS, BEEPS)  (SHOUTING GIBBERISH)    This is some good stuff, Chris.  I think it's ready to post.  Actually, Stewie, I changed my mind.  I made my own video and posted it.  What? How could you do that?  Stewie, I didn't want to do all that fancy stuff,  so I just did a video of me speaking from the heart.  You know, telling her how much it would mean  if a girl like her went to homecoming with a guy like me.  I couldn't even stay awake during that description.  (PHONE VIBRATES)  Hey, she already posted a response.  What?!  Hey, Chris Griffin.  I just saw your video,  and I'd love to go to your dance with you.  All right, I got to go eat an ice cream cone.  'Cause us stars are just like you.  Oh, my God!  (BOTH CHATTER EXCITEDLY)  Uh-oh. This means I have an awkward phone call to make.  What? No, no, it was stupid.  What, two guys going to homecoming?  I-I assumed it was a goof this whole time.  Take it out.  I'm ugly and unlovable.  Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.  Our top story tonight,  pop star Taylor Swift is coming to Quahog  to attend a dance with local high-schooler Chris Griffin.  But first we go to commercial while our sports reporter smiles  and spins a football for some reason.  (SPORTS THEME PLAYS)  Wow, Chris, I'm so excited!  You actually have a date with Taylor Swift!  Thanks, Mom. Did I do good?  Can I wear Grandpa's jacket now?  I-I don't know why you always ask for that.  Th-That's not a thing in our family.  Oh, Rupert, I can't believe Taylor Swift  is actually going to be in our house.  I haven't been this excited  since I abused those caffeine pills  to get ready for the big show.  Everything will be fine, as long as I take one of these.  Pills? You actually are taking drugs?  Stewie, give me those.  I can't, Zach! I need them to sing!  (GRUNTING)  I'm so excited, I'm so excited   (CRYING): I'm so scared!  (SOBBING)  Screech is going to stab someone on Christmas.  Oh, Chris, you look so handsome in your tux.  This must be how Meat Loaf looked when he went to the prom.  - (DOORBELL RINGS) - Oh, that must be her!  (EXCITED YELL)  Hi. You must be Chris. I'm Taylor.  (SHOUTS): What's up?!  (CHUCKLES)  It's so nice to finally meet you.  Your video was so sweet.  And I can't wait to go to the dance tonight.  Me, too. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)  Would you like to come in?  Hi. Peter Griffin, leering dad.  Quick question: in ""Shake It Off,""  you invite us to get down to, quote, ""this sick beat.""  Yet the beat you then provide is rather mild.  My question is this: may I lick your legs?  Hi, Taylor. Stewie Griffin. I'm your biggest fan.  I don't mean that like a psycho, I just  I-I'm not, I'm not a psycho!  Oh, you're a cutie.  Okay, so let's talk about Harry Styles.  Now, you don't have to say anything.  I'm just gonna slowly pull out this tape measure,  and you indicate when I should stop.  Okay, here I go.  Still going.  Still going.  Oh, my God, you bitch! Seriously?  Taylor, this is my sister Meg and our dog Brian.  Nice to meet you both.  We're not all so impressed.  I've met Dan Aykroyd.  I'm sorry, uh, which cast member of Hee Haw are you?  Will you be nice!  Okay, well, we should probably go.  It was so nice to meet you all, except for the girl and the dog.  Sorry about my family.  Don't apologize. They seem nice.  Well, you wouldn't say that if you ever saw us at the movies.  All right, we got our popcorn from home,  our soda from home, our snacks from home  and Braveheart.  (TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING OVER LAPTOP)  - Where you headed? - The airport.  Great. Just a couple of errands and we'll get you there.  (NO AUDIO)  (DOOR BELL JINGLES)  That was one bitch of a class.  Anyways, what time's your flight?  It's in 20 minutes!  Oh, boy, I can't make it in 20 minutes.  I better call you a Lyft.  - Come on, hurry up, get in! - (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)  I hope you like The Offspring.  Let's go!  (GENTLE POP MUSIC PLAYING)  Oh, my God! Taylor Swift!  She's here with him?  You guys, Mr. Buell's taking  a door-open dook in the bathroom!  I hope this isn't too boring for you.  No, this is so cool!  I always sing about high school,  but I've never actually seen one in person.  (UPBEAT SONG BEGINS)  Would you like to dance?  Sure. But you're gonna have to stand back,  like, five and a half feet.  Cool!  You dance like an unattended fire hose.  Wow! It's like your dance tells a whole story.  Right?  You are the only one who's ever gotten that.  Usually people just shove a wallet in my mouth  and call 911.  You know, Chris, I'm having a great time.  You're so cool and down-to-earth.  I like you, too, Taylor.  I was scared meeting a celebrity,  but you're so nice and normal.  I feel totally comfortable around you.  Well, why don't you just kiss her, Griffin?  Sorry, I just smoked a joint with the pickup truck kids.  (FROGS CROAKING, CRICKETS CHIRPING)  That was really fun, Chris.  I hope you don't mind I made the band  pay me a royalty for each of my songs they played.  Of course not.  And I hope you didn't mind  I showed you who every locker belongs to.  No, I thought that was nice.  I've never had a locker.  I just keep my stuff in stupid mansions.  Can I finger you?  Sure!  Hi. I'm Taylor Swift.  I'm famous, but I'm really nice.  Aw, that's one of the best fingerings I've ever had.    What are you working on there, Chris?  Oh, I'm making a collage for Taylor  of some of her favorite things.  Here's flowers and crop tops  and pictures of Kanye West with his mouth shut.  Wow, you two seem to have a wonderful connection.  We do, Mom.  You know, she's the first girl to ever really understand me.  Uh, you guys?  You might want to see this video Bonnie posted on Facebook.  Why are you on Bonnie's Facebook page?  'Cause she's a (BLEEP) smoke-show.    'Cause I know you're   Just blubber in a dress shirt   He licked his armpit   Then ate all my dinner and dessert   Chris Griffin is a pig in every way   Oh, oh   Blubber, blubber, blubber, oh   Blubber, blubber, oh.   Oh, and some animals give him boners.  (BALLOON POPS, ""AULD LANGNG SYNE"" PLAYING)  What the hell?  Why would she do this?  Wait, wait, wait. What's that next video?  (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)  Oh, Daughtry!  I'm a mom, so I love this.  Chris, what happened?  I-I thought you said Taylor had a good time the other night.  We did!  She even let me grab the part of her body  which on others would be a butt.  Wow, look at these comments.  Everyone hates you, Chris.  She's right. Check it out.  You're already a meme.  Aw, man, Chris, this computer is telling me  that you done Swifted up.  Why would she do something like this?  Because this is what Taylor Swift does.  She gets into relationship with guys,  sabotages them, and then writes angry songs about it.  I just wish I could talk to her.  Well, why can't we? She has a house in Rhode Island.  We could go today.  (GASPS) Oh, my God, we can go today!  My schedule is wide-ass open!  Well, we can't just show up there.  Why not? We've done crazier things before.  Remember when we sent that tweet?  All right, you ready?  Freeze!  We're the Internet police!  You guys are going away for a long time.  Hey, what are you in for?  I said Caitlyn Jenner wasn't brave and beautiful.  Brian, there's some bad people in here.  Hey, what's up? I'm just going to Quahog Stadium.  Okay, would you like the AC on or the windows down?  How about both?  (GASPS)  Pretty great, right?  It is! It really is!  Thank you, genius person!  No problem.  Hey, you ever go in a hot tub when it's snowing outside?  Oh What?!  Ms. Swift, your songwriting team is here.  We got a socko tune for you, Taylor.  Hit it, Morty!  (PLAYING OLD-FASHIONED PIANO MUSIC)  Lox and bagels and bagels and lox   I like being a girl.   Okay, one thought.  What if we change ""lox"" to ""boys""  and ""bagels"" to ""problems""?  Oh, that's perfect.  Like when you changed ""pickle it good""  to ""shake it off.""  All right, we got our homework.  Hi, Taylor.  Chris? What are you guys doing here?  I wanted to talk to you.  Your house is way nicer than Anne Murray's.  We broke in there, too.  Taylor, why'd you write that song about me?  I thought we had a real connection.  We do. I really like you, Chris.  I just  I'm sorry. I always do this.  I ruin relationships with nice guys and John Mayer  just so I can write songs about heartbreak and moving on.  But don't you think that's unhealthy?  You're never gonna find a real relationship  if you keep doing this.  Listen, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, Chris.  Let me make it up to you.  Why don't you guys all come to my show tonight as my guests?  Are you serious?!  Backstage with Taylor Swift?  Well, that'll be even cooler than when I was in that remake  of The Princess Bride with Bill Cosby.  Now, one of these has the iocane powder, you see,  and one of them makes you go sleepy-bye with your mouth open.  Hey, pal, where we heading again?  Just go down this dark alley.  What the hell's going on?  This is what we do to Uber drivers in this town.  (GRUNTS)  (GRUNTING)  Stop! Stop! Please stop!  The sound of your leather jackets is excruciating!  You can't just buy a phone and become a cab driver!  Please, I have two families!  (GRUNTING)  (CABBIES HISS)  Stay back!  Where-where did you get that?  Judd Hirsch himself.  I was a boy, no more than 11 or 12.  Was on the side of the road.  Man with a hat pulled up next to me.  Said I reminded him of him when he was my age.  I was just a boy husking corn.  Didn't know what it meant.  Of course, we were all husking corn back then  just to keep the lights on.  And you burned my car  while I was telling my fake Judd Hirsch story.  (UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING)  (CROWD CHEERING)  God, I hate everybody who's not backstage.  This next song is a new one.  It's about my boyfriend Chris.    I'm pretty and I'm rich and I'm in love   Me Taylor   I've met the guy that I've been dreaming of   Me Taylor   (CROWD BOOING)  Wow, they hate it.  This stinks!  We like you when you're miserable!  You guys, Mr. Buell's taking a door-open dook in the bathroom!  Why were they being so mean to you?  Well, I guess they're just used to me being sad  and hurt by men.  But I don't care if they like it, Chris.  I'm happy with you.  I'm happy with you, too.  But it doesn't seem like your fans like this  new happy Taylor.  Are you willing to risk losing them  and jeopardize your career and your art just for us?  I think I am.  (CROWD BOOING, CLAMORING)  Oh, well, I don't know if am.  What? What are you saying?  (INHALES DEEPLY) I'm saying that  Taylor Swift, you are a spoiled ostrich-legged,  no talent, big-footed freak.  You pretend to relate to your fans,  but you make your bodyguards carry your purse.  All your songs sound the same.  And your cats aren't that cute.  Thank you, Chris.  This next song is about my dumb ex-boyfriend,  who either mistreated me, cheated on me  or went to massage parlors when I was out of town.  (CROWD CHEERING)  Wow, Chris, that was really nice of you.  Yeah, I guess.  Don't worry, there'll be plenty of girls for you.  No one will ever be close to as good as her,  but we'll find you someone.  What about, like, a motorcycle lady?  You know, like an old gal?  Her grandchildren call her by her first name?  Let's get out of here. I called us an Uber.  (SLURRING): How many tooths is not enough tooths?  Well, kids, your father may have gotten beat up,  but Uber's still a great job  for anyone afraid to sell their blood.  And, Chris, I'm sorry it didn't work out  with you and Taylor Swift.  I think we're all sorry about that, Brian,  but I'm afraid we are out of time.  I would like to thank our guests Taylor Swift,  Chris Griffin, Stewie and Brian,  Cleveland Brown and his band of Brown Renown.  Hey, we'll see you down in Brown Town, huh, Cleveland?  Oh, I ain't even gonna go there, Peter.  (PLAYS SLIDE NOTE)  We apologize to the greased-up deaf guy.  Didn't have time for him tonight,  but let's see if we can get him back next week  when Amanda Peet will be here with stand-up Dom Irrera.  Good night, everybody.

S15e6,ANNOUNCER:,We now return to Rational Geographic.  BRITISH
S15e6,"NARRATOR:","Upon realizing a trip to Africa  would be smelly and gross,  our crew decided to stay in the office.  Aah! Mom, Dad! A bat, a bat!  Oh, my God, there's a bat in the house.  Okay, all-all right, everybody just calm down,  it might just be Grandpa Munster.  Somebody set him up for a funny joke.  Hey, Grandpa,  how did you sleep last night?  Yeah, see, if it was him, he would have said,  ""Like I do every night: upside down.""  Okay. But Peter,  we can't have a bat flying around the house.  We got to do something.  Don't worry, Lois. I'll get rid of it.  It'll be a piece of cake.  Just like my penis enhancement.  I want it to hang down to my knees.  They moved up my knees.  Everybody, I've come up with the perfect plan to catch the bat.  I bought this remote- controlled toy helicopter,  to which I have attached this handgun.  And I tell you, this thing is not easy to fly.  - Peter, that doesn't seem very - Here goes.  Now, I don't have anything to control the trigger with,  so I put it on a timer.  But I don't remember how long I set it  Aah! We're all gonna die!  Okay, so, now the bat has a gun, and the knives I gave him.  What? Why would you give him knives?  I didn't think it would matter.  I was counting on this helicopter thing working.  Peter? Wh-where are you?  What's going on?"
S15e6,PETER:,"In order to understand the bat,  we must first understand the vampire.  So I watched Interview With the Vampire.  Cast your gaze upon  Lestat.  Peter, you're not a vampire.  Oh? Then why am I clad in velvet pants  tucked into soft leather boots?  And why does my shirt billow so  in the wind of that rotating fan?  Peter, what's really going on?  I'm just tryin' to reinvent my look.  A guy at work said I dress like crap.  Well, you show 'em tomorrow, Peter.  How'd it go?  I was sent home early and labeled a distraction.  They're having a meeting about me tomorrow.  (ALARM BUZZES)  Wha Wh-What's wrong?  Ar-Are we taking a terrible 7:00 a.m. flight?  No no. I realized to catch a bat,  I need to live like a bat. So I got to be up at night.  It's a nocturnal mission, Lois.  Okay, but what are you gonna do?  Well, as everyone knows,  bats watch a ton of Cinemax softcore porn,  so that seems like the place to start.  (WOMAN MOANING)  - A-ha! - (SQUEAKS)"
S15e6,MAN:,"Welcome back to CNBC's Moneyline.  Oh come on, man, nobody's buyin' that.  You expect me to believe you own stocks?  Bat Industries was up two dollars a share today  in heavy trading.  - Huh. - (SQUEAKING)  Get back here! Damn it!  Aah!  (SQUEAKING CONTINUING)  I got you now, Bat Damon.  I named you Bat Damon.  Aw, now I want you to live.  Aah! Aah! What is it?  - Aah! - Ow!  You can beat me, but I am who I am!  Peter, what the hell did you do to Stewie's hand?  It could be broken.  I didn't mean to. It's just,  sometimes I don't think before I act.  Oh, hey, high-five.  Hey, did you just high-five that sign?  Yeah.  You think differently.  Get in."
S15e6,PETER:,"His name was Derek.  But he went by the Prophet when times were good,  or the Law Giver when times were bad.  I moved onto his prayer farm with 45 other members  of the Salvation Star Boys, who died in a mass suicide.  But not me. 'Cause I don't like root beer.  And I only drink what I like.  After it was all over, I called Lois to pick me up.  She was mad.  But she's what Derek calls an Oppressing Doubter.  May the light of Derek's Invincible Diamond  shine through you.  Oh, thank you so much for coming in early, Dr. Hartman.  Oh, no problem.  - Hell, I used to work here. - What?  Good news. Stewie's hand looks fine.  Oh, hey, high-five.  Huh. As long as you're here,  I see Stewie hasn't had his vaccinations yet.  Should we take care of that?  Well, I suppose so.  Oh, but first, I'm required to have you read this pamphlet  about the risks of vaccinations.  God, you are aging so rapidly.  ""Possible side effects:  fever, severe allergic reaction, muscle and joint pain?""  Wait, and this can't be right:  they actually put some of the disease in the shot?  Hey, man, how many questions your lady ask?  Uh, like, a million?  But I don't remember having to read any of this  when Chris and Meg had their vaccinations.  Well, that was before Internet chat rooms  made everybody an expert.  It's a better world now.  I-I don't know about this, Dr. Hartman.  We might need a little bit of time to think this over.  Yeah, 'cause we don't want to make a big mistake.  Like when I peed next to the chatty guy.  (ALARM RINGS)  Hey, man, we should get out of here,  the building's on fire.  Hey, pal, not now, I'm busy.  Anyway, I'll tell you what's on fire, my urethra.  That's the last time I go to a water park,  I'll tell you that much.  Well, that's not completely true,  'cause I have a Groupon, and I'd hate to waste it.  Plus, the truth is, the kids  Oh, my God  I was the chatty guy.  Hey, you guys, is that my laptop?  Yeah, sorry, we were looking something up.  We were going to get Stewie vaccinated,  but now, after our research, we're definitely not.  Ah, no, Lois, don't tell me  you fell for all that anti-vaxxer crap.  It's not crap, Brian.  There's a lot of evidence to suggest there's a link  between vaccinations and autism.  Lois, all that so-called evidence has been debunked.  Listen to some of these ingredients:  ""mercury, thimerosal, aluminum, formaldehyde.""  Lois, deciding not to vaccinate Stewie  is something that affects all of us.  The only reason they work  is that if a critical mass of society gets immunized,  then the diseases won't spread.  Look, Brian, I was skeptical, too,  but then I did some research  and I found some very interesting things  from the leader of the anti-vaccination movement,  Jenny McCarthy.  See? Proof.  Hard to argue with that.  And look at this one.  Glasses.  Case closed.  I can't believe you guys.  Don't you realize you're contributing  to a potential public health disaster  by not vaccinating your child?  That's exactly the point My child.  He's my child,  and nothing matters more than his well-being.  Oh, God, this is going to be a Lois story, isn't it?  Game of Thrones is on, just a reminder.  Yeah, we made this mistake before.  We got the other kids vaccinated,  but Meg still got chicken pox.  Dad, this is acne.  Girl, you nasty.  You realize the vast majority of people think you're wrong.  Well, maybe that's the problem.  We just got to change their minds.  We're gettin' this town to change its mind  about vaccinations.  Yeah. I'm with you.  Just as soon as I finish gettin' the word out  about the one thing more important.  The brothers who made The Matrix are ladies now!  They're ladies!  Just one of 'em?  That's the thing It's both of 'em!  What are the chances?  What are the chances?!  The brothers who made The Matrix are ladies now!  All right, come on, Peter,  I've got all the stuff for our anti-vaccination rally.  I don't believe this.  It's bad enough you guys  aren't vaccinating Stewie.  Now you're trying to convince other people  to make the same reckless choice?  I'm also gonna pet a bunch of dogs without asking.  Don't do that. We don't like that.  Then I'm gonna try and look at their teeth.  Brian, all we want is for parents to have the choice.  Because parents know what's best for their kids.  I hear Sansa finally shows boob in this one.  You do realize they're putting your life in danger  by not getting you immunized.  You could get measles, mumps, rubella, whooping cough  Oh, my God, are you serious?  Very serious. Even the tiniest germ  could make you very ill and, left untreated, kill you.  Really?  I'd expect this kind of thing  from the fat man, but not Lois.  Although she did act like a nutcase  that time she went shopping right before Thanksgiving.  Ready for Turkey Day?  (CHUCKLES) Clever.  Don't eat too much turkey tomorrow.  (CHUCKLES) Oh, I won't.  Now, if only the meal would cook itself, huh?  (CACKLES LOUDLY)  (OVER P.A.): Parents of Quahog  and weekend dads playing three minutes of catch,  do you know that the number of childhood vaccines  has tripled in the last generation?  And why is that?  Because heartless corporations make billions of dollars  by foisting garbage and poison upon our children.  We demand that these vaccines  be tested by independent researchers,  not by the companies who make them.  Excuse me, are you the lady selling the bullhorn?  What? No.  I'm over here.  (SIGHS) Damn it.  This doesn't seem to be working.  Well, obviously, Lois.  You can't just go to a park  and list a bunch of boring facts.  You got to spice things up.  Like I did when I was a lounge singer  with uneven lyric density.  This is a song I wrote for my beautiful girlfriend.  Her name is  Kim   I don't understand why your father   Has such problems with us   Kim   Mostly I think it's because   I don't make my car payments on time   But also because I was dating someone else   At the same time as   Kim   Two, three, four,  (RAPIDLY): five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.  Kim   I love you   But mostly I love that you let me eat crackers in the bed   Kim!   Thank you!  (PLAYS FINAL NOTE)  (RHYTHMIC TAPPING)  (RHYTHMIC CLINKING)  (RHYTHMIC ICE RATTLING)  (CLAPS) Eh, that's enough of that.  What the hell?  Peter, is that you on TV right now?  Oh yeah, that's my anti-vaccination PSA.  Hi, I'm a medical guy,  and I'm here to give you the facts about vaccs.  Fact Vaccinations cause autism,  paralysis, and even  death, death, death, death, death, death, death,  death, death, death.  Fact: ""vaccinate"" rhymes with ""masturbate.""  Would you let a doctor do that to your kid?  Fact: I still think Michelle Williams is Carey Mulligan.  Fact!  Medical delivery for badass karate doctor.  Ah yes, those must be the bones and skulls.  (BONES CLATTERING)  I see no boob bones, the victim was a man.  Wow."
S15e6,SINGER:,"Oh, yeah!"
S15e6,ANNOUNCER:,"Say ""no"" to vaccines.  Paid for with Meg's college fund.  What the hell is all this?  I'm trying to protect myself from all those diseases  I'm not vaccinated against.  Speaking of which, do you have any idea the germs  you routinely track into this house?  From now on I'm going to ask that you wear these shoes  while indoors.  Where'd you get those?  Put 'em on and lick your lips!  Stewie, you might be taking this too far.  Proper hygiene depends on everyone, Brian.  For instance, I've already saran-wrapped Chris.  (MUFFLED): I'm a gas station sandwich!  (DRAMATIC MUSIC ON TV)  We interrupt this program with breaking news.  Childhood vaccination rates in Quahog have dropped  to an all-time low, fueled by a recent media campaign  led by local meddler, Peter Griffin,  shown here in the basket of Henry Thomas' bicycle.  That can't be real, right?  Oh, I knew one of these had to be my house.  Damn it, Peter, thanks to you,  nobody in this town is vaccinating their kids anymore!  Do you even realize the harm you've caused?  Harm? What are you talking about?  I'm making the world a better place.  Like when I was the Instagram police.  (SIREN WAILS, THEN STOPS)  Sorry, lady, got to crop the chotch.  I will take this.  And cutaway complete.  (SIREN WAILS)  Man, there is a lot of bad art in these hallways.  All right, Stewie, see you after school.  Wait a minute, where are all the other kids?  Haven't you heard?  There's been an outbreak of measles.  It's all because everyone stopped vaccinating their kids.  Oh, my God!  And it's not just our school.  Kids all over town are getting sick.  (AIR RAID SIREN BLARES)  OFFICIAL (OVER BULLHORN): Attention! Attention!  What the hell?  (CROWD CLAMORING, SIRENS WAILING)  People of Quahog,  your town is under quarantine.  Until further notice, no one may enter or leave the city.  Oh, that's the guy who bought the bullhorn at the park.  Oh, this is awful.  It's all our fault!  And look, Joe's arguing with a state policeman  over jurisdiction.  Thanks, Swanson, we'll take it from here.  It's a state matter now.  No way, this is my town.  Thanks, guys, the feds will take it from here.  Oh, no, this is my state.  Hi, I'm a crossing guard who can walk,  so I have jurisdiction over all of you.  Must be serious.  They brought in the big guns.  You happy now, Lois?  Because of you, there's a measles epidemic,  and the whole town is quarantined.  Speak for yourself, Brian.  I, for one, am enjoying the indoor family time.  Who's up for another game of hot-breath telephone?  (LOUD, MUMBLED WHISPER)  We're all gonna die!  Chris, you're supposed to whisper that to the next person.  Peter, Brian's right!  We were wrong about everything!  We've got to get to the hospital and get Stewie vaccinated!  Eh, it might be a little too late for that.  I kind of destroyed all the vaccines in town.  (EXPLOSIONS, GLASS SHATTERING)  All right, what else did I have to do today?  Ah, yes, overdose in my apartment.  I better get home.  You destroyed all the vaccines?  Yeah, but it's fine. There's nothing to worry about.  Is anyone else feeling feverish, achy,  and acutely sensitive to light?  Oh, my God, Peter.  Y-you've got measles!  Now, hold on, hold on, before we all freak out,  it might just be full-body herpes.  Wait, you guys, Dad might not have been vaccinated.  Didn't Grandma say he was born in Mexico?  Nobody remembers that, Meg.  We got to keep you away from Stewie.  You'll get him sick.  Oh, my little guy's gonna be fine.  All he needs is a good, old-fashioned game  of hot-breath telephone.  (BREATHY WHISPER): Measles.  (YELLS) I've got to get out of this house,  or I'll be in worse shape than John Goodman!  I've got your EKG here.  How does it look?  Well, it spells out ""Pancakes.""  Oh, okay, so same as last time.  I'm recommending you go on a strict diet immediately.  Nope.  Horses that make it look like I can walk,  take me to Hollywood!  All right, I'm almost done packing.  I've got it down to four bags and a hatbox.  I'm gonna need some help, Rupert.  Rupert?  Ew, that's the tushie thermometer.  Dear God, you're burning up!  I have to get out of here!  I'm sorry, Rupert.  But the situation here has become unbearable.  Like talking to someone with adult braces.  So, yeah, last weekend, Sheila and I took the kids  up to the lake, it was great.  We had great weather, fired up the barbecue,  Sheila's parents came up towards the end of the week  (LOUDLY): When are you gonna get those off?  (WEAKLY): Meg, you must carry on my legacy.  Promise me you'll crop the chotches.  Crop them, Meg!  Crop them all!"
S15e6,LOIS:,"Peter, Stewie's gone!  I've looked everywhere!  Oh, Lois, I feel a little better.  I think I could keep down deviled eggs.  Lois, what's wrong?  I can't find Stewie.

S15e6,BRIAN:,"Ah, it's just Billy.  He died of measles.  And here comes Marmaduke to lick up the vomit.  Lucky.  If I can just escape this quarantine  and make it to the next town,  I'll be able to get that vaccine I need.  Stewie! I'm you from the future!  You've got to get the hell out of town before you get sick!  Yeah, I know. That's what I'm doing.  Okay, I'm really here because I know you have glue.  Give me the glue.  (INHALES DEEPLY, THEN MOANS)  Stewie, listen to me,  never, ever do this great thing I love.  There's the bridge out of town!  So we're all there at the Clam,  just kind of making music together,  and then Peter, of course, had to join in  and clap his hands, and I said, ""Eh, that's enough of that.""  (CHUCKLES) Yeah, I kind of run the group.  I'll just have to go around them.  Good Lord.  I hope my shoe doesn't fall to make me realize  how far the drop is.  (SPLASH IN THE DISTANCE)  Oh, my orthotic was in there.  (TIRES SCREECH)  Stewie?  Where are you?  Lois, what's going on?  That's one of my sidekicks' wives.  He says he's in charge of the group, is that true?  No, not in the slightest, but, Joe, Stewie's gone missing.  We can't find him anywhere.  Lois, look!  (GRUNTING)  I don't know if he can hold on much longer.  We got to get him down.  Stewie, hang on!  Mommy's coming!  (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS)  Oh, no, upside-down train!  (YELLS)  - Stewie! - Oh, no!  (CONTINUES YELLING)  Sean Penn?  That's right, two-time Oscar winner Sean Penn.  What are you doing here?  I'm bringing vaccines into your quarantined town.  Any time there's a public health crisis in a third-world land,  I'm there.  Third world? This is Rhode Island.  Oh, really?  Have you seen some of the delis on Federal Hill?  Oh-ho-ho! Rhode Island slam!  Ho-ho! I like you, Sean Penn.  Oh, my God, you saved my baby!  Thank you so mu Oh.  Sean Penn.  You're the one who played that homosexual.  Yeah.  All right, well, I'll take my son now.  I've brought enough vaccines for your whole town.  I hope you've realized that vaccinations are not  a freedom of choice issue, they're a public health issue.  Thanks to them, countless serious diseases, mumps, polio,  smallpox, and rubella, have been all but eradicated.  Like clean water and functional schools,  vaccinations are a human right.  Great, just what I needed, a lecture from liberal Hollywood.  This whole thing has been a lecture from liberal Hollywood.  Well, it's a relief that everyone's been vaccinated,  and the quarantine has been lifted.  Well, I'm just happy that Stewie is healthy,  and only 150 people died, but not anyone we knew personally.  Yeah, I know I sure learned something.  (TAPPING ON WINDOW)  Hey, do you like apples?  Yeah.  Well, I got her number.  How do you like them apples?  Oh, Bat Damon!  You got the best of me again!"

I come down here to think every night  and gaze at that green light.  It's where the love of my life lives,  Daisy Buchanan.  Um, I hate to break it to you,  but that light you've been looking at  is a gay gym called The Pump House.  I-I only know that because I saw a coupon that came with my rental.  Um anyway, Daisy's house is over there.  - She's my cousin. - Daisy's your cousin?!  Yeah. Lot of weird coincidences for an American classic, huh?  Wha I have to see her!  Well, I can set that up.  Um, only thing is she's married.  Yeah, and I hear her husband's a real heel.  Whoa-hoa! Language!  But yeah, I'll set it up.  Um, tea tomorrow at my house, 2:00 p.m.  Great. She's she's gonna be there, right?  Yeah. Why wouldn't she be there?  I don't know, I'm just getting a funny vibe from you.

(BAND PLAYING MELLOW JAZZ)  This is amazing!  I've never seen so many shirts.  D-Do you have enough to, you know, throw?  Yeah, you know, they're actually kind of expensive  Ah, there she goes.  Shirt! Shirt! Shirt!  Shirt! Shirt!  Okay, five is good.  Five is-is probably good.  Shirt! Shirt!  (CHUCKLES): Were you, uh  were-were you this crazy when we dated before?  Mm, Gatsby, is it?  I've been hearing about your vast newly acquired wealth  and your attentions to my wife.  So I thought I would have you over  to my equally large and fancy  but imperceptibly more classy mansion  for an awkward dinner.  And, Nick, have you met Jordan?  She plays golf, and is what kids will someday call a ""DUFF.""  Hey, yeah. Nice tam-o'-shanter.  I'll drink your finger bowl if you don't want it."
S15e7,STEWIE:,"In the book, I actually go on a few dates with Jordan.  We're gonna skip all that.  Anyway, like I was saying, you're a trash,  'cause you earned your money a little bit more recently than me.  - What are you getting at? - I'm saying I invited you over  and sat you next to my wife to say,  ""Stay away from my wife!""  You know what we should do?  Let's all drunk-drive into Manhattan  and get a hotel room  and have the same conversation we're having here.  I'm starting to think this isn't a very good book.  I'd like to add another bit of pointless confusion  that will make sense later.  Let's everyone drive somebody else's car.  Someone can take my coupe.  I'm riding with Gatsby, I don't care which car.  I'll take someone in Daisy's car.  I don't think Daisy said you could drive her car.  Tom, why don't you take Jay's car?  - Who's Jay? - Gatsby.  Okay, I have never heard anyone call him that.  Look, if you're in your own car you're in the wrong car.  All right, you guys get gas.  I got to talk to this random mechanic's horny wife  about some business.  Wilson? Gonna need to fill 'er up!  Wilson's wife? Fill 'er up? Get it?

Don't tell anyone how bad I look naked.  Have fun raising my bastard.  All right, let's head out.  Wait, but first I want to see  if we're in the funny horn era.  (OLD-FASHIONED HORN): Ah-ooga! Ah-ha! We are!  All right, Gatsby, you think you're so hot?  Let me show you how a classy guy does classy stuff.  Hello, room service? I'd like a bottle  of your second most expensive champagne.  And I'd like your most expensive bottle.  Wow. Walked right into that one.  Okay, fine. Well, then let's see who has higher socks.  Nya-ha!  Whatever, Tom. None of that matters.  Daisy's in love with me.  In fact, she's never loved you.  Oh, is that so?  Well, I hear Gatsby didn't even fight in World War I.  Wait, why is he calling it that?  Is there gonna be another big war?  I'm sorry, Tom.  That's right. I'm in love with Daisy,  and she loves me, old sport.  Would anyone like a deviled egg  from a tea I had several days ago?  Well, that was awful.  But I sure do enjoy driving your car  instead of you driving it,  even though we came in a different car.  Drunk. Don't forget drunk.  You're drunk-driving my car.  Gas and sandwiches!  Get your gas and sandwiches!  (GASPS)  Oh, that must be Tom, since I saw him in that car earlier!  Tom! Tom! It's me!    Oh-ho, no!  Myrtle!  Where will I ever find another woman  with a hotter name than Myrtle?  (SIGHING): All right, pool, do your thing.  You hungover? Uh, a little bit, yeah.  Okay, we're sort of racing to the end here.  And with that, I shall step  slightly out of range.  All right, I'm just gonna take a quick swim.  Oh, my God! Where are the stairs?  There's no stairs! I'm never gonna make it!  You were standing earlier in the day  next to the car that hit my wife.  (GRUNTING, GROANING)"

Only problem is, I really want to get  to that trunk of costumes in the corner.  On the one hand, I don't want to give away my location.  On the other hand, there might be a pirate hat.

Aw, Widow Douglas,  I already been to church three times today.  I want to stay home and play Angry Birds.  (SQUAWKING)  (PIGS SNORTING)  (CHUCKLES) This is addictive.

Now come on, I need to use your pee.  I'm taking a wagon test in the morning.  I wish you wouldn't drink so much.  Stop countin' my drinks!  Now get over here so I can whip you!  Ow! Pap! No!  Yeah, that's right, bitch.  Now it's your turn  (SNORING)  Geez, this is worse than the Widow Douglas' house.  I got to get out of here.  I know. I'll fake my own death.  I just need enough blood to make it look real.  Hey there! You must be Huck.  Great to finally meet you.  I hope you like it here.  I'm gonna stab you for your blood.  Oh, come on! I just got shot in the pool in the last one.  (GROANING)  I can't remember why I needed the blood.  (BIRDS CHIRPING)  (FIRE CRACKLING)  Lord, I'm-a tell ya,  being a slave is a much worse job  than the temp agency made it sound.  You gonna eat all that possum?  I am. My name's Huck Finn.  What's half of your name?  Jim. Nice to meet you.  I'm a runaway slave.  I'm runnin' away 'cause people want me  to wear shoes and comb my hair.  So I guess we got the exact same problem.  (DISTANT WHOOSHING) Hey, what's that sound?  Oh, no! It sounds like  a waterfall!  Hold on!"

That's a once-in- a-lifetime skip!  - That's nice. - You don't believe me, do ya?  I believe we've been out here a long time,  and a man's mind begins to play tricks on him.  It happened for real!  I can't believe you didn't see it!  Of course I saw it.  Most amazing damn thing I ever did witness.  But I wasn't gonna tell Huck, 'cause he claimed  he didn't see me hook-shot that apple core  into the garbage from way far away.  Hello, friends.  Why are you so friendly? You con men?  No, we're businessmen.  We're fake-selling the Brooklyn Bridge.  Don't say ""fake-selling.""  We're real-selling the Brooklyn Bridge.  Stop qualifying the selling.  We're just selling the Brooklyn Bridge.  - I'll buy it. - Hold on, now, Huck.  These fellas are con men.  Push off, you grifters.  We don't want to ever see you again.  Fine, we're going!  It's a river we can't control how fast it goes.  We can barely steer!  Sorry.  (ROOSTER CROWING)  Hey, what if it's spelled with an A at the end of it?  Is that okay?  Jim? Jim?  Jim? Jim?  If you're looking for a gym, Ye Olde Pump House is that way.  Can't miss it. Green light on a dock.  Tom Sawyer? What are you doing so far from home?  Rush is playing here tonight.  They wrote a song about me.  Oh. Well, I'm looking for my friend, Jim.  Huck! Great news! I'm free!  You are? That's awesome! When did that happen?  It's just being revealed now,  but it happened hundreds of pages ago.  Oh. Huh. Weird.  (SIGHING): So, uh, what's left to do?  I'll tell you what:  Rush concert!

Well, while I'm being booked and processed downtown,  we have time for one more classic of American literature.  This one's about idiots choking rodents.  I give you Of Mice and Men.  - Read him his rights. - You know what?  I'm like to read 'em myself.  ""Chapter one: eat my ass, pigs.""  Aah! The bones in my nose!  Wow. I remember when this used to be all orange groves.  It's it's currently all orange groves.  Tell me again about our dream, George.  All right, all right.  We're going to open a bed-and-breakfast in the country,  and we won't be afraid to let our guests know  that we are Steelers fans in this house.  - What about the rabbits? - Yeah, we'll have rabbits, too.  But we'll also have a sign in the front that says,  ""Steelers fan parking only.""  And sometimes we'll give our guests a fake hard time.  Like if they're Jets fans, we'll be all like,  (CHUCKLING): ""Okay, I hope you don't get towed.""  But obviously, you know,  of course, we're not gonna tow 'em.  Hey there, strangers.  Welcome to Phelps Ranch.  - People call me Slim. - Ironically, I assume.  Listen, we're looking for field work,  uh, if you need any extra hands.  Well, three of our guys did just get squished,  so we just might. Come on in.  So, have you done this kind of work before?  Have we pulled an object off a plant  and placed it in a burlap bag?  Yes, I think we understand the nuances of this profession.  Good, good. And how about you? Tell me about yourself.  I like to kill animals and then a lady.  I got a good feeling about you guys.  All right, you guys are doing great.  Hey, listen, my dog just had puppies,  and I thought, since you're covered with feces and I barely know you,  I'd give you a delicate, snow-white, newborn puppy.  Okay, just don't give me to Dead-Eyes over there,  'cause I've already been killed twice  in the other two stories, and I don't want  Puppy! Aw, (BLEEP)!  (CRUNCHING)  This puppy doesn't work!  Well, well, well  As you can tell by the ""well, well, well"",  he's the bad guy.  Looks like we got us some new employees.  That's right, Curley, I hired 'em this morning.  Well, tell 'em to get out.  This is where I practice my karate, 'cause I'm a dick.  I understand you like to pick fruit.  You ever pick something bruised and pear-shaped?  Fruit has seeds you can poo out!  Hey, Hodor, stop coming on to my slutty wife!  Look, I can tell by the fact that you wear a single,  Vaseline-filled leather glove that you're a reasonable man.  So, let's all take a deep breath and calm down.  No! Karate chop!  (GRUNTING)  (BONES CRUNCHING)  (YELLS) Damn it!  I tuck my jeans into my boots!  I'll get you, you stupid, giant moron.  Not great timing, I know,  but can I leave early for a dentist appointment?  So, I should be home by 10:00.  It's just this piano-bar-slash-cabaret place  called ""Tinkles.""  Rory told me about it.  Who's Rory?  You remember him.  The field hand who gave me a shoulder ride  back to the house?  That was Rory.  Anyway, it sounds like it's just a hoot.  Wow, maybe you'll meet a pretty lady to get married to there.  Yeah, well, that's the idea.  While you're gone, can I touch myself?  Uh, again, you don't have to schedule that with me.  But remember, if there's any trouble,  we meet by the big tree on the edge of town.  Everything in my head is screaming.  All right, then, I am off.  Well, hello there.  If it isn't the sexy imbecile.  Oh, hi.  Sorry about what I did to your husband earlier.  Yes, that was quite a hand job you did on him.  You know, I'm not so bad at those myself.  I'm not gonna lie to you,  you're wasting your double entendres on me.  (QUIETLY): I want you to destroy me.  Okay!

Oh, I just love a song that explains what it just said.  (INDISTINCT WHISPERING, STEWIE SIGHS)  All right, evidently I have to go to the big tree  on the edge of town to take care of something.  This shouldn't take too long.  Do not take my songs off the list.  (CRICKETS CHIRPING)  I'm sorry, George, I didn't mean to kill the girl,  and now the whole town's gonna hang me by a rope.  Oh, I would never let that happen.  Thanks.  - Tell me about the rabbits, George. - Yeah, sure thing.  But while I do that, why don't you face away from me  and count the stars.  Okay.  All right, so the B&B will have a rack of single-gear bikes  for every guest, and yes, next to that, of course,  is going to be the big, giant rabbit hutch.  - Buh-bye, Lennie. - (BODY THUDS ON GROUND)  Goodnight, kids.

No, this is something I ordered, for me.  I am a woman and always have been.  I've made plans to undergo surgery  so my wang don't get in the way of the woman what I am.  Ay, dios mio.  Lois, I'll still be a parent to our children.  But now I'll be a trans-parent.  Get it? Transparent?  Clever pun, right?  Please, honor me for my courage.    I think gender-reassignment surgery is very brave  and the fat man should win some kind of award for it.  - The fat woman. - He hasn't chopped it off yet.  That doesn't matter. Peter already identifies as a woman.  And on karaoke night, I identify as George Michael.  That doesn't mean it's true.  Brian's just mad because he has to be the lady one.  Which makes you the one who's gay in real life.  Daddies, I'm standing here, delivering my line  with more emotion and less of a monotone  than the actual Lily on Modern Family.  I'm now confident enough to share my truth  with the rest of my loved ones, beginning with my son, Chris.  Bazinga, Father.  Assuming father is still the appropriate designation.  What-what are you doing?  Waiting for the laugh to die down.  I'm here because I've decided  to become the woman I am inside.  Can you find it in your heart to accept me?  Oh, Dad, science has moved so far past  binary gender construction.  And if being a woman makes you happy,  then in the words of Mr. Spock, ""It's only logical.""  Wow, I couldn't follow any of that,  but look how smart your audience is.  Ha-ha.  Louis C.K.? Is that you?  Yup. I'm a big fan of yours, Peter.  Wow, that's great because if Louis C.K. likes something,  - everyone has to. - That's right.  Well, I'm glad my popularity has cooled off just enough  that you were able to get me to do this.  Bye, Peter.  Boy, he's not afraid to go there, I'm told.    - Norm! - Norm!  Ative gender roles have been turned upside down.  Correct, Quagmire.  I'm going in for gender-reassignment surgery.  What the hell, Peter?!  First my dad and now you?  Am-am I is it am I doing this to people?  Is it do you guys feel like cutting off your penises?  No, but I can turn it inside out like rolling up a dress sock.  You guys aren't supporting my choice?  Well, what do you expect, Peter?  I-I mean a sex change operation?  Why are you doing this?  I'll tell you why I'm doing all of this.  For me.  M-E. M-E.  I'm doing it for M-E.  (CRYING)  Ew. I mean, yay!  (CRYING)  Man or woman, I'm a big fat joke.  No one takes me seriously."

They hated it so much, they gave us a negative Emmy.  We now owe them an Emmy.  (ALL GROAN)  The Emmys aren't fair.  I mean, shows like Nurse Jackie are basically dramas,  but they get comedy awards all the time.  (GASPS) That's it.  We'll sneak into the drama category.

No, Chris, it's Mr. Robot.  - Chicken. - Mr. Robot.  - Chicken! - No, no, Chris, you see,  Mr. Robot is a critically acclaimed show.  Robot Chicken is something kids used to watch in 2006.

Now, since I'm holding the camera,  I'm gonna need some help with my belt buckle.  And there you have it, Family Guy reaches a new low  as it grovels and begs for a meaningless award.  I would say they've got about as much chance of winning an Emmy  as the Republican Party has of accomplishing something.  (AUDIENCE LAUGHS AND CLAPS)"
S16e1,MAN:,"Peter, over here.    Bill Maher? What are you doing not smirking outside a church?  Uh, yeah, I was just doing that.  Uh, look, Peter, I'm here for two reasons:  first, to find out who that Asian girl was on the couch,  and second, to tell you that  Family Guy will never, ever win an Emmy.  Okay, first of all, that was Asa Akira.  I think you knew that.  Second, are you sayin' there's a conspiracy against us?  (WHISPERS): Follow the Emmy.    (LIGHTNING CRACKLES)  (THUNDER RUMBLES OUTSIDE)  It's back this way.  And who was that Asian girl on the couch?  I think you knew who that was.      (TRILLING)  To convey this moment of shock  at the depth of the conspiracy around me,  here's Ryan O'Neal in the movie Tough Guys Don't Dance.  - (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS) - Oh, man.  Oh, God. Oh, man.  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  Oh, God. Oh, man.  Oh, God. Oh, man. Oh, God!  (TIRES SQUEAK)  Peter, there you are.  I've been calling you all night.  Where the hell have you been?  No time to explain.  This Emmy thing goes deep.  The same people win year after year after year.  It's like there's some kind of secret society  that takes all the awards and is keepin' us from getting one.  Yeah, I know. They're all here to see you.  - Hello, Peter. - (GASPS)  The Michelin Man?  You're part of this?  No, I'm two-time Emmy-winner Alec Baldwin.  Peter, stop snooping around the Emmys.  Yeah, butt out. It's none of your business.  Well, why not, Julie Bowen?  Huge fan, by the way. Just huge.  What are you hiding?  What's the big, secret reason  Family Guy can't win an Emmy?  All right, we'll tell you.  Your show sucks.  Peter, I'm famous writer Aaron Sorkin.  Walk and talk with me.  You wouldn't know my work because  I don't write for Juggs magazine.  Let me explain ""writing"" to you.  You can't take a scene from Ferris Bueller,  cross out the name ""Ferris,"" and replace it with ""Peter.""  And the racial stuff on your show is just embarrassing.  You have people of color voiced by white actors.  - No! - Yes!  Hell, I'm Shonda Rhimes,  and I'm being voiced by a white actor.  And worst of all,  you take this big pile of garbage,  and you tie it all up by having everyone sit around saying,  ""At least everything's back to normal,""  as if something happened.  When nothing happened!  It was a complete waste of everyone's time!  (SAD MUSIC PLAYS)  Well, I'm glad all this Emmy nonsense is over  and things are back to normal.  Yeah, me, too.  You know, I may not get Emmys,  but I do get the best award of all My family.  And this e-mail from a young fan.  ""Dear sir, your show helped me  when I was going through chemotherapy.""  Aw.  ""My favorite episode was when Homer stays home from church""  Ah, damn it, he thinks we're The Simpsons.  Hey, what do you say, one last try?  Why not?  Ladies and gentlemen,  please enjoy this spectacular, live-action chicken fight,  starring Ty Burrell.  Good night!  (WEAK CHIRPING)  Shh. Shh.  (WEAK CHIRPING)  I don't have any more room in my house."
S16e2,MAN:,"Sir? Sir, can you hear me?  There he is.  Welcome back, buddy.  - Who are you? - I'm a paramedic.  Name's Stryker Foxx.  (BELL CHIMES)  Oh, Lois just texted.  ""Burgers or meatballs for dinner?""  I'll text back for you.  ""Same thing, bitch. Just different shapes.""  (IPAD CHIMING RAPIDLY)  (CHUCKLES): Oh, this is gonna be fun.  Oh, battery died.  Sir, you've sustained a head injury.  How many chicken fingers am I holding up, and do you want one?  Three, and hell yeah!  Mmm. Aw. These are amazing!  Did I die and go to heaven?  Well, you didn't die, 'cause I saved you.  And you're not in heaven 'cause you're not holding a margarita.  Oh, wait a minute, yes, you are.  You brought a lot of food in the bathroom.  I always do.  Oh, my God.  Are you the coolest guy ever?  Ah, that's just a silly title they gave me  down at the Karate Paintball Dirt Bike Club.  Awesome!  Okay, well, bandaged you up.  You should be good to go.  But just be more careful next time.  I know. What a stupid injury, huh?  I haven't been this embarrassed  since I was a rookie firefighter.  (ALARM RINGING)"
S16e2,PETER:,"Sorry, first day. Still learning.  Hey, Stryker, wait!  Hey, listen, I just wanted to say thanks again  for patching me up.  No problem, buddy.  Hey, that's an interesting necklace you got there.  Oh, this? It's from when I was a kid.  It's half of a ""best friend"" coin.  I always had this crazy dream  that one day I'd run into the guy with the other half.  Oh, my God. Cody?  Oh, that must be the name of the dead surfer I found this on.  TV"
S16e2,ANNOUNCER:,"We now return to the Olympics.  Ugh, it's so annoying.  They always use football announcers  for events they know nothing about."
S16e2,ANNOUNCER:,"The players are ready to take the swimming field.  (ALARM BUZZES)  And they're swimming!  They appear to be doing the forward stroke.  My neighbor has a pool.  I'll take a dip if I know they're on vacation.  It's neck-and-neck, and it looks like Canada won!  Uh, no, they're going back the other way.  What do you think? How do I look?  Like a gas station energy drink.  But you put that on to go to the Clam?  Aren't the guys gonna think you're a little overdressed?  Oh, I'm not hanging out with the guys.  I met someone new.  His name's Stryker and he's really cool.  Like, he's one of those guys whose forearm hair  makes his watch look even cooler.  (PHONE RINGING)  (GASPS) It's Stryker!  I want him to think I was listening to a cool song.  Pump up the jam   Yeah, who dis?  Oh, hey, man.  Oh, nothing much. Just getting slurped.  - Ew. - Oh, you're almost here?  Okay, just, uh, just give me a second  so I can put away all my guitars.  Okay, Seacrest out. Bye.  (MUSIC STOPS)  What the hell was that?  Lay off. Nothing.  (KNOCK ON DOOR)  Hey, Peter.  Hey, man.  Hola, cha-cha, hi-hi.  - Peter! - I don't know. It's-it's this house.  I-I got to get out of this house.  Boy, Dad sure seems excited.  I know. I haven't seen him this giddy  since he discovered that single-loop roller coaster.  (GIGGLES)  Ah  (GIGGLES)  Ah  (GIGGLES)  Ah  Uh, don't feel so good.  (RETCHES) Ew!  Ah  (RETCHES) Ew!  Ah  (RETCHES) Ew!    Wow, what a cool loft.  I bet it cost a ton to make this place look unfinished.  Hey, come over here. There's someone I want  to introduce you to, 1997 George Clooney.  Wow! That's the coolest George Clooney there is!  Hi, George Clooney, second worst Batman.  Peter Griffin, second best Homer.  You may have heard, I'm also known  for my practical jokes on the set.  One time, I nailed Nora Dunn in the head with an apple.  (LAUGHS): That-that's hilarious 'cause you're handsome.  Otherwise, you're just some dick who hit a lady.  Aw, thanks for bringing me here, Stryker.  I'm having the best time ever.  Even better than when I lived in Santa Fe.  Have you ever seen a prettier sunset?  Never.  It's just so peaceful here.  It sure is.  Mm. Sure is.  Did you also have a very public meltdown in another city?  - I did. - Yeah. Yeah.  (KNOCK ON DOOR)  Ugh, it's the guys.  What do those losers want?  Losers? Those are your friends.  Nah, they're lame.  Not one of them has ever vaped at a funeral.  Hey, Peter. Hey, what are you doing tonight?  We're gonna watch Cleveland  put a garbage can full of coins in a Coinstar.  Sometimes it takes my buttons.  Eh, thanks, guys, but I-I can't make it.  I'm, um, I'm getting re-circumcised.  Got a wedding next week.  I just want to clean it up a bit.  Oh, well, that's too bad. Yeah, maybe next time.  That sounds horrible.  Peter, why did you just lie to the guys?  'Cause I got plans with Stryker.  I don't want them to embarrass me.  Eh, I get where he's coming from.  That's why I never introduce you to my friends.  What friends?  Like the guys in my photography club.  ""Dear Gary Glitter, Jeffrey Jones  and Jared from Subway,  I feel like I'm the only one sending pics.  I love all the positive feedback,  but maybe you guys send a pic?  Anyway, here's more pics.""    Hey, you ever try that? Wingsuiting?  I mean, basically, yeah.  One time, I jumped off a top bunk  with a towel around my neck like a cape.  It was inside the IKEA.  I landed on a cardboard computer.  We should totally do that sometime.  Nah, I can't go back there.  They got my picture by the door.  Hey, he is in here.  What the hell are you guys doing here?  We were coming back from the Coinstar  and saw your car out front.  Rough night. Turns out the can was all buttons.  We're not gonna make our mortgage.  What are you doing here?  I thought you were too busy to go out tonight.  Peter, who are your friends?  Oh, um Stryker, this is Quagmire, Joe and Cleveland.  How do you two know each other?  Did you meet at the Harry Potter store?  Peter loves that place.  It was one wand and I was using a gift certificate.  No, we actually met when I was administering first aid to him.  - I'm a paramedic. - For real?  Hey, can I show you seven or eight things on my body  and ask for medical diagnosises?  This thing here that looks like a second elbow,  I don't know what it is.  Feels like it's filled with liquid.  Well, I could take a look at it.  No, no, no, guys, guys, it's his night off.  I have two pee holes.  Stop it! Stop it. Guys, can I talk to you?  Look, this, this right here  is exactly why I've been avoiding you.  I knew you'd embarrass me in front of Stryker.  Who cares? He's just some dude.  He's not ""just some dude.""  He happens to be the first really cool friend  I've ever had.  What are you talking about? We're cool.  You are absolutely not cool.  Oh, yeah?  Well, then why did those teenagers on the way in say,  ""Cool wheelchair, dick""?  Hey, look, Peter, if you're so embarrassed by us  and you think we're losers,  well, then we don't want to hang out with you, either.  Good. Who needs you bums? I got Stryker.  Oh, yeah?  Well, I hope you two are happy together, you jerk."
S16e2,BOY:,"Cool wheelchair, dick."
S16e2,JOE:,"Thanks. Did you see the backpack hanging off it?  Wow, you know,  I never thought I could be talked into wingsuiting.  You're gonna love it.  It's just a short hike from here to the summit.  A hike? It's no problem.  Shouldn't affect my old football injury.  I spilled hot chili on my nuts.  You're a riot, Peter.  Hey, you sure you're up for this?  Oh, hell yeah. When I commit to something, I go all the way,  like when I had Kathleen Turner's voice.  (KATHLEEN TURNER'S VOICE): Good morning, guys.  Peter, what's wrong with your voice?  I got punched in the throat at the Clam last night.  Now I sound exactly like Kathleen Turner.  I'm just gonna get my stromboli.  Hey! Get away from my stromboli, Kathleen Turner!  (SHOUTS)      Wow, that's, uh that's some view.  I know, isn't it?  You see that rock formation over there?  We're gonna fly right through the center of it.  It's called threading the needle.  Totally intense.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah. Or-or how about this?  Maybe you jump off this cliff  and I spin around over there and sing Sound of Music.  Or-or we could just go home and watch Sound of Music.  I can see you're a little nervous, Peter,  but I'm telling you, it is easier than you think.  Watch.    Wow, look at him go.  You know, just when I thought  he couldn't get any cooler, he goes (BLEEP)  Oh, my God! Oh, my God!  Oh! What-what just There's almost nothing left of him!  And I just know I'm gonna be the one  to have to intify the body.  (CRYING): That's him. Poor guy.  He looks like a bowl of tomato soup.  Guy next to him died in a fire  He looks like a grilled cheese sandwich.  Oh, these two poor souls are the best combination  for a rainy Saturday.  So, hey, guys.  What are we drinking? Beer?  Hey, Quagmire, how about one of your famous sexual stories?  Take a hike, Peter.  Ah, oh, you-you mean something Joe can't do?  (LAUGHS)  Friendly jokes indicating closeness.  We heard about Stryker dying.  Ah, craps.  Yeah, give it up.  We know the only reason you're here  is 'cause your cool friend is gone.  That's right. We're not your floppy seconds, Peter.  It's actually ""sloppy.""  Well, for me, it's both.  But listen, you really hurt our feelings.  You can't just treat us like garbage and then expect us  to take you back like nothing happened.  Okay, that's-that's too bad 'cause that was kind of my plan.  Well, you can go to hell, Peter.  We're tired of you taking us for granted.  Yeah, and this isn't even the first time  you ditched us for someone else.  Remember when you blew us off  to hang out with Jerry Seinfeld?  Julia Louis-Dreyfus has a lot of Emmys now.  Yeah.  Why did your wife steal that cookbook?  Peter, I'm sorry about your friend Stryker.  I know it's got to be hard to watch a man explode  like a bug on a windshield.  No, it's not that  I mean, I do see that every time I close my eyes  But it's the guys.  They're really mad at me, and I'm-I'm afraid  they don't want to be friends with me anymore.  Well, it's hard to blame them.  You treated them like you don't even care about them.  I do care about them.  It's just, when I hung around with Stryker,  people thought I was cool, and it-it felt good.  No one ever thinks I'm cool.  Your friends thought you were cool, until you dumped them.  Oh, wow, I guess you're right.  I treated them like crap.  I just got to find a way to make it up to them.  You got any ideas?  Mom? Dad? Can Gary Glitter, Jeffrey Jones  and Jared from Subway spend the night?  I don't know, Peter,  but it's got to be something really meaningful,  because imagine how they feel.  After all, you were willing to jump off a cliff for Stryker.  Well, they didn't say yes, but they didn't say no.  You're right.  Thanks, Lois.  And now I know exactly what I have to do.  Uh, where the hell are you going?  Lois told me to go jump off a cliff  to prove my friendship to the guys.  Are-are you, are you sure that's what she said?  I-I don't know, Brian. Her shirt was kind of open.  I was trying to get a peek down there.  Anyway, I got to go jump off a cliff.  Peter, wait. H-Hold on. This is crazy!  Damn it.  Where's Peter going?  Huh?  Oh, for God's sake.  Hey, Quagmire, Cleveland and Joe.  It's your buddy, Peter, and I'm about to thread the needle  to prove to you guys how sorry I am  and that I'd do anything to win you back.  And if something goes wrong and I don't survive,  you can go ahead and delete  the Kennedy Center Honors from my DVR.  I'm-I'm never gonna watch that.  Okay, here goes nothing.  I just wish the sponsor on msuit was a little cooler."
S16e2,CLEVELAND:,"Peter, stop!  Don't jump!  Brian told us you were gonna  Why are you wearing a douche suit?  They also make wipes!  They're not known for their wipes.  Peter, you don't have to jump off a cliff  to prove you're sorry.  Not all of us believe that, but we took a vote  and I agreed I'd respect the majority.  Look, you really treated us badly,  but the fact that you'd be willing  to literally risk your life just to show us how much you care,  well, that says a lot.  Listen, I'm so sorry.  If being cool means don't get to hang out with you guys,  then I don't ever want to be cool.  What do you say? Can we just go back to being friends?  - Of course. - You bet.  Totes McGoats.  (LAUGHS) ""Totes McGoats""?  Maybe you guys are cool. Fist bump.  Ah, crap! (SCREAMS)  - Oh, my God! - Peter!  Should I shoot him, make it go quicker?  I got a shot.  Too late. You didn't answer quick enough.  (SCREAMING)"
S16e2,PETER:,"Hey, I'm doing it.  This ain't so hard.  Guys, I'm gonna do it!  I'm gonna thread the needle!"
S16e2,QUAGMIRE:,"What? We can't hear you!  We're very far away!  Oh, my God, I did it!  I was actually able to thread the  Oh, crap, Canadian goose.  Look out, eh?  (SCREAMING)  (BIRDS SQUAWKING)  Oh! Damn it! Ah! Son of a bitch!  (SCREAMING)  (GRUNTING)  (GROANS)  I think I'm okay.  Ah, nickels!  Well, it's good to be back, you guys.  A-And I'm sorry again I dumped you for Stryker.  Who the hell is this Stryker guy you keep talking about?  What do you mean?  He's that cool, handsome guy I was friends with.  He's the whole reason I went wingsuiting and hurt my head.  Wingsuiting?  Peter, you hurt your head in a ladies' bathroom.  Yeah, your legs fell asleep and you bashed it against a sink.  You were in a coma for two weeks.  You must've dreamed about this Stryker or something.  No, we were buddies.  We rode on his motorcycle.  And he introduced me to 1997 George Clooney.  Okay, well, right there you should've known it wasn't real.  Huh.  Well, whether it was real or not,  I want you to know you are the best friends I've ever had.  Of course we know that, Peter.  Yeah, and we feel the same way.  Hey, this is a really weird question,  but do you boys want to go out dancing?"
S16e2,PETER:,"That night,  we danced until the sun came up.  We forgot all about my coma  and my crazy dream about a cool guy.  We were just four middle-aged men  doing Ecstasy at a Mexican prom.  I'm Peter Griffin, and these are my stories."
S16e3,ANNOUNCER:,"We now return to The Last Man on Earth  Plus These Other 16 People with More Showing Up Every Day.  No way they'll pull this off.  A show with just one character  and an unlimited number of other characters?  Peter, you can't just sit there and watch TV all day.  - You have to mow the lawn. - Aw, this sucks.  I was gonna go down to the Guitar Center  and annoy people."
S16e3,FYI:,"My mom's not picking me up for a long time, because  she's dead!  Hey, Brian, you want a beer?  Peter, Lois is gonna be home soon.  Shouldn't you be mowing the lawn?  I am mowing the lawn.  (BLEATING)  - Where'd you get these? - Craigslist.  Boy, that's got to be some long list."
S16e3,WOMAN:,"and pool tables and jukeboxes  Craig, are you getting all this down?  Yes. Is that it?  No! Futons, everyone's grandfather's golf clubs  I-Is that it?  No! Gay sex  - What kind? - All of it!  I have milked all the goats.  Peter, all those goats are males.  Well, the buckets are full and the goats are happy.  I just hope word doesn't get around.  I like good times."
S16e3,ANNOUNCER:,"We now return to Top Gun  with only public domain music.

Peter, get out of there.  Lois, what's going on here?  Well, I asked Peter to mow the lawn.  Will somebody turn off Top Gun?!  (SONG STOPS)  So obviously he bought a herd of goats,  and now they've taken over the house.  Lois, I worry this is not a healthy environment  - for the children. - Mom, please.  You know I would never put my children in harm's way.  Oh, boy. AMBER Alert.  Stewie was last seen with a goat in a '98 Toyota Tercel  heading north on I-95.  How do you turn those off, by the way?  Lois, I've seen enough.  You're completely overwhelmed, and you have four children.  (CHUCKLES) Four children.  (CHUCKLES) Four children.  (CHUCKLES) Four children.  (CHUCKLES) Four children.  (CHUCKLES) Four children.  Hey!  You need help, Lois.  And since I don't believe in psychiatry,  I'm getting you a nanny.  Well, I guess it would be good to have some help  with Meg and Chris.  And Stewie, if he's ever found.  Honey, do you think that's the goat and baby  - from the AMBER alert? - Uh, it's a Tercel,  but I don't think it's the right year.  (DOORBELL RINGS)  That must be the new nanny.  Is this the Griffin house?  Welcome to this work environment.  Oh. I'm not the nanny. I'm her Uber driver.  Your nanny's still in the car.

Well, if you must know  Welcome to this work environment.  Okay, Natalia, level with me.  Why are you really here?  I have been sent to neutralize liberal Jewish dissident,  Fievel Mousekewitz.  Oh. Well, the only mouse in this neighborhood is  our innocent neighbor, Frank Maxwell.  Comrade Mousekewitz!  Did you think you could run forever?  I, uh, I think you've got the wrong mouse.  I'm just regular old Frank Maxwell,  and I'm very late for work.  Good day, ma'am.  (STARTS ENGINE)  Whoa! You killed him?  That was not me.  Someone else got to him first.  Tough break, Jew mouse.

Goodnight glowing milk.  Goodnight bleeding grandpa's eyes.  Goodnight two-headed cat.  Goodnight nobody.  Goodnight blocks and blocks and blocks of nobody.  The end.""  Next book.  Everybody Poops  Blood.  I'll get started on dinner.  No need to start dinner.  Homework is done. Kids are fed.  You two should go out and have lovely evening.  - Together? - Yes.

How, uh  how's the stuff you do during your day?  - Good. - Good.  So is that it?  Did we do a date? Phones back on?  Peter, we finally have a chance to reconnect.  We've been given this opportunity.  It's like before we had kids.  We got to make the most of it.  H-Hang on, hang on, Lois.  Give me two of those round balls of butter and a breadstick.  You'll see where I'm heading with this.  Okay, look, look, look. Here's what you want.  - Here's what you got. - (CHUCKLES)  I'm very happy with what I got.  Hmm. Well, maybe I can give you half a breadstick later.  As long as you don't mind a little marinara dipping sauce.  That's absolutely disgusting.  And I love it.  You know what? I like date night.  To Natalia, for making it possible.  Pretty sure that's Steve's pee.  Enjoying your wine?  Oh, what an amazing night.  I told you we could have a fun time, just the two of us.  Fun's not over yet.

S16e3,PETER:,"Come on, let's get in the trunk.  I filled it with water so we can do it hippo-style.  Weightlessly,  with my feet lightly scraping the bottom as we do it."
S16e3,LOIS:,"Okay. It's kind of sexy, I guess."
S16e3,PETER:,"And in the hippo tradition,  first we must eat a whole head of lettuce.  - Now, do you have the lettuce? - I-I didn't know we were doing this.  Did you bring the lettuce?  Oh, no, I forgot.  Ronald, I asked you to do one thing.  Honey, honey I brought the lettuce.  So thanks to Natalia,  we've been spending so much more time together.  Let me tell you, Joe, it's really been a rediscovery.  - Hmm. - Joe, ""we time""  - is just as important as ""me time."" - Okay.  We've actually been watching The Middle together.  It's so funny! Isn't it funny, Peter?  It is actually funny. At least three times an episode  we turn to each other and we say,"
S16e3,BOTH:,"""That's just like us!""  - (LAUGHING) - (LAUGHS)  Why are you laughing?  - It sounded funny. - But you had to be there.  Well, I was able to imagine myself there,  which is why I chuckled.  Oh, and, Donna, have you seen this Black-ish?  - Why are you asking me that? - I don't know.  It seems like you might like it.  Oh, and, waiter, have you seen this Fresh Off the Boat?  - Why are you asking me that? - I don't know.  It seems like you might like it.  Oh, there's Mort. Mort!  Have you seen this The Goldbergs?"
S16e3,MORT:,"Yes! I like it 'cause I'm Jewish.  Boy, our friends all seem to be happily married.  - (BOTH LAUGH) - Yeah, right.  You know, Donna told me in the bathroom  she and Cleveland haven't had sex  in over three months.  I love that you share things  that were told to you in confidence.  - Oh, and the poor Swansons. - I know.  Joe's dead from the waist down,  and Bonnie's dead from the waist up.

S16e5,STEWIE:,"On a March day, with a temperature of 64 degrees,  my father lost his position  with the Pawtucket Brothers Brewery Company,  near our village in central Quahogia.  Needless to say, it would change our lives forever.  What does it say? I can't read spaghetti.  You're relieved of your position.  I see. And what's to happen to my play?  The opening is only days away.  The play's off."
S16e5,STEWIE:,"With no discernible reaction,  my father made his way home to deliver the news to my mother.  Let me tell you about my house.  We lived in a New England cottage  that was inside a vintage Army tent,  that was inside a decommissioned submarine,  that was all inside an old airplane hangar.  I've lost my position  with the Pawtucket Brothers Brewery Company.  And the play is off.  (GASPS)  We have to inform the children."
S16e5,STEWIE:,"My brother Chris had spent his life  conjoining his twin loves,  medicine and escape artistry.  Eureka.  A possible cure.  (BUZZES)  Do you want to do a Spider-Man kiss?"
S16e5,STEWIE:,Our dog Brian had been making a name for himself  on the pickleball court.
S16e5,ANNOUNCER:,And that's match for Gene Porterfield.  Are those marking sole shoes?  I'd like to officially file a grievance.
S16e5,STEWIE:,Brian had quietly become the most successful  grievance filer in league history.  I'll be there right away.
S16e5,STEWIE:,"The exterior of our house is a lighthouse now.  Inside's the same.  Okay, back to the story.  I've summoned you all and arranged you  in a perfectly symmetrical form in front of me  to tell you some important news.  I've been relieved of my position at the brewery.  What of the play?  The play is postponed, indefinitely.  No, Mr. Griffin.  You need to do this play.  We'll help you.  But I've lost access to the brewery.  That's where the whole piece is set.  Maybe it doesn't have to be.  But that's where the free tape and paper is.  I'll buy you new tape and paper.  The play is back on."
S16e5,STEWIE:,"On an overcast Thursday afternoon,  my father presented his play,  one of the most compelling stories of the 1980s,  Max Dugan Returns.  Max, you've returned!  I have.  (CHEERING)  This took a lot of work.  (GERMAN VERSION OF ""I GOT YOU BABE"" PLAYING)"
S16e5,STEWIE:,"My father passed away in the spring of his 43rd year,  and was put to rest in the family graveyard.  He died chasing a PokÃ©mon across a busy street.    Hey there. It's me again.  Wouldn't it be great if Wes Anderson's movies  were actually that short?  Anyway, the Hollywood Sign is more historic than you think.  On this very spot, 52 years ago,  a piece of beef jerky was planted in the ground  and watered with Red Bull.  A speedboat erupted from the soil,  and in that speedboat was Michael Bay.  (EXPLOSION, SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)    This already doesn't make sense.    You're fired, Griffin,  for destroying company property.  Tell it to my tongue.  (BOTH BABBLING)  Mr. President, we have a situation.  The Decepticons plan to destroy the Seven Wonders of the World,  starting with the Hagia Sophia.  The what? Is that even one of the Seven Wonders?"
S16e5,CARTER:,The Decepticons have only one weakness.  They're allergic to beer.  I don't like the taste either so much.
S16e5,CARTER:,"That chest plate is where they're most vulnerable.  If we could find someone strong enough to throw a keg  with enough force, we might have a shot.  (8-BIT BEEPING, EXPLOSION)  The only problem is, there's not a man alive  who can throw a keg with that kind of force.  There may be one."
S16e5,BRUCE:,"I wonder who it is.    Our top story, stopping the Decepticons with beer?  According to our sources,  the search is underway for a man strong enough  to throw a keg with enough force  to save the Seven Wonders of the World.  (KNOCK AT DOOR)  What took you so long?  There was a train and I like to count the cars.  It was a big one.  Me, too. That is fun.  But you're wasting your time coming here.  I don't throw kegs anymore.  (SULTRY MUSIC PLAYS)  Who's this?  What are you wearing? That's my funeral shirt.  Look, Peter, I didn't want to ask you to do this  because of that maverick but awesome thing you did  in the battle war of the past.  Is this the stuff you didn't want me to ask you about?  I told you not to ask me about that.  He went rogue and saved everyone's lives,  but he didn't do it by the book.  Is that why he can't get an erection?  Everyone stop talking about me!  Listen, it's not me that's asking,  it's America.  (FIREWORKS WHISTLE)  Tell America my answer is ""no.""  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go change my mind  in the shower.  POWER BALLAD"

S16e5,PETER:,"Hold on!  Damn it, I'm in.  But I do things my way, and I pick my crew.  Deal. Now let me sit sideways on your motorcycle  like a Vietnamese woman, and let's get out of here.  (ENGINE REVS)  (TIRES SCREECH)  Still trying to put the world back together, I see.  Hello, Peter.  We're not joining your team.  I'm putting together a team.  - We're in. - Good.

Trying to grow some balls?  Okay, okay."
S16e5,LOIS:,"Play nice, boys.  (SULTRY HARMONICA TUNE PLAYS)  Love the cookie-cutter house you and Poindexter got here.  Never pegged you for a burbs dweller.  Peter, you used to live here.  That was a long time ago.  It was two months ago.  Two months is a long time  when you don't sleep and only eat ground beef.  Did you tell Chris about my mission?  I thought you should."
S16e5,CHRIS:,"This is my favorite  out of all the Seven Wonders of the World.  The Hagia Sophia.  It's like God made a basilica for himself.  Dad, nothing bad will ever happen  to the Hagia Sophia, right?  Not on my watch.  TOM"

It's suicide.  Take care of my kids' bikes.  They're expensive.    Oh, my God!  I can't believe Peter's gone.  I never got to repeat to him the line he said to me  earlier in the film that has taken on new meaning  in the context of all that has happened.  (BAGPIPES PLAYING)  Today is the day we honor the late Peter Griffin,  the hero who saved the Seven Wonders of the World."
S16e5,PETER:,"Who's that ugly son of a bitch?  Peter, you're alive.  But-but how?  You were blown into a million pieces.  Luckily, I know a couple of pretty good welders.  Wait, they-they welded you back together?  A-And they knew you were alive the whole time?  You want to ask questions or you want to do it in a cemetery?  (BOTH LAUGHING)"
S16e5,LOIS:,Is is everything all right?
S16e5,PETER:,"Yeah, no, I-I think I'm just tired  from all the flying back and forth.  Maybe we just talk here for a little bit,  and then you can tell everyone that I functioned as I should."
S16e5,LOIS:,"Yeah, uh, okay."
S16e5,PETER:,"So, which director thing was your favorite?  Mine was this one."

Wow, I've never seen someone go oh for six in 15 minutes before.  Just hard rejection after hard rejection.  (INDISTINCT SHOUTS)  - What's going on over there? - Looks like a student rally.  They probably forgot to study for an exam,  so they organized a protest.  In the '90s, you'd just pull a fire alarm  Now you hold a protest.  That is, when they're not looking down at their phones.  Hey, what's going on?  Someone wrote ""weird"" on the transgender bathroom,  and the school president didn't overreact,  so we want him fired!  Seems reasonable.  Exactly!  Oh, I see news cameras.  I'm gonna yell ""Viva la Stool"" like a young, white drunkard.  And last week, a professor told his class to have a nice day,  which is microaggression,  because in our systemic rape culture  no day is a nice day.  So we want him fired, too.

I'm not allowed to touch anything in their house.  And, besides, today's Dolph Lundgren's birthday,  and me and the guys always celebrate it  by watching Rocky IV.  Fine, we're probably better off without you.  You always find a way to embarrass us at my parents'.  (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)  Please pass the All Fruit.  Pass the Polaner All Fruit."

Please pass the All Fruit.  Clearly the matriarch. She's got the most pearls.  Pass the Polaner All Fruit.  Weird sexual tension there."

(STATIC)  What the what the hell?  Try blowing on it.  (BLOWING)  - (STATIC) - Crap! It doesn't work!  Well, we got to watch the movie. It's our tradition.  We could just stream it on your Apple TV.  Is that what that is? I thought it was a coaster.  I've been putting cold, wet things on it for a month.  Turn it on. I'm sure we can find Rocky IV on there.  I don't know how to turn it on. It doesn't have any buttons.  Well, maybe it's voice-activated.  Rocky IV! Rocky IV!  Let's just go to the damn store.  Hold on, hold on, let me try screaming at the PlayStation.  Hey, you guys, why the long faces?  Eh, we were trying to watch Rocky IV  and our DVD didn't work.  And that's just Scottie Pippen.  When I was a baby,  they pulled me out of my moms real slow.  We got a bin of old movies.  Rocky IV might be in there.  Let's see.  Talladega Nights, everywhere.  Ladybugs, classic Rodney.  A Million Ways to Die in the West, no, thank you.  Here it is! Rocky IV!  Aw, nuts, this one's written in terrorism.  That's, uh, Cyrillic.  It's a Russian bootleg.  All right, we'll take it. It's better than nothing."

If there's anything I can do  No, you've been great.  I mean, you don't even need to be here right now.

That chocolate thing from the bucket list?  We're all good. Let's do it.  Toblerone probably isn't the best thing for this.    Brian? It would mean the world to me  if you wore my tux from when I got married.  I love you, buddy.  Yeah, I'm not wearing a fat guy's old clothes.  And Wha Is this a flap on the butt of these pants?  Yup. In case of emergencies.  My invention. Called it the Suit-Chute.  Got it patented in '97 and went into business.  Shot a local commercial and everything.  I'm Peter Griffin, inventor of the Suit-Chute.  Are you about to walk down the aisle  and afraid you'll leave it brown?  Did you eat creamy soup just before the opera?  Are you George Brett at an awards ceremony?  Then you need a tux with the Suit-Chute.  Don't take my word for it.  Ask famous Hollywood actor- slash-pants filler Dennis Franz.  On NYPD Blue, I'm known for packin' heat.  But every year when I go to the Emmys,  the heat I'm packin' is clumpy and smells terrible.  Not anymore, thanks to the Suit-Chute.  And the winner is  your socks and shoes.  The business died, and I lost $200,000, Brian.  Want to know why?  ""555"" means it is not an actual phone number.  I truly wish I had known that.  Brian, I want nothing to do with this sham wedding.  So if you're going to ask me to be your best man, don't.  I'm not. I want you to be the ring bearer,  and wear a vest and a boutonniere  - and carry a satin pillow - Sold, sold. Yes, I'm in.  But it's still wrong. There's no way  you'd be marrying this woman if she wasn't going to die  - in two weeks. - Oh, come on!  Did you know that Lois was so moved  she called Channel Five to do a profile of me and Jess?  And now get out your tissues, it's a real-life Quahog version  of The Fault in Our Stars,  the novel and hit movie your gay nephew quotes on Facebook.    My name is Jess.  I have cancer.  But cancer doesn't have me.  My name is Brian.  I have a disease  called love.  It may have started in my penis,  but it spread to my heart.    And, Brian, when you learned Jess had only weeks to live,  you proposed.  Yep. Got in right under the wire.  No one's ever loved me like Brian does.  You know, sometimes at night I just watch Jess sleep for hours.  And I go, ""Hey. Hey, you alive?""  And she says, ""Yeah,"" and then I go, ""All right, good.""  (SNIFFLES) I'm, uh I'm sorry.  (CHUCKLES) I'm sorry to be a puss.  Hey, pal.  Listen, I kn-I know we've had our differences,  - but you're a good guy. - Thank you, Quagmire.  Listen, I want to throw you the wildest bachelor party  of all time. It's gonna be crazier  than whatever Kanye West is doing at this particular moment.  I'm giving this lasagna a massage  while preparing to announce I'm joining ISIS.  Thank you for your interest.  This is delicious.  Hmm. I still think the butter cream  was the best cake I've thrown up so far.  Oh, speaking of which. Mwah!  Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you.  A-Are you the dog who's marrying the cancer girl?  Oh, uh, yeah, I am.  Oh, my God, we saw you on the news last night!  You are just the best person. I can't even.  How's she doing?  Honestly, not well.  She's only got ten days.  So in ten days you'll be alone?  I guess.  Well, maybe not.  I'll give you my number.  Here, I'll put my number in with my tongue.  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.  I'm not sure that's a complete number,  but I'm gonna call you first.  Wow. I haven't gotten this kind of attention  since I went to see The Peanuts Movie.  - Look. - There he is.  That's him.  That's the guy who peed in his empty soda cup.  (CRYING)  (ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING)  Hello, Brian, I'm Jess's mother, Helen.  Oh, hey.  L-Listen, I've been wanting to talk to you.  I-I was thinking maybe you could move in with me and Jess,  because I-I know you'd want to be with her for her final days.  Well, now, thank you, Brian.  That is such a sweet offer.

Jess, I wish we had a million years together.  But what we have is this moment,  and I wouldn't trade it for anything.  With this ring, I vow to honor you and cherish you  for the rest of the month.  Ma'am, do you take this doggie to be your husband?  I do.  Yay!  How about you, doggie?  Samesies?  - I do. - Yay, again!  By the power bottom vested in me,  I now pronounce y'all husband and wife.

It's fine, it's Tinazidine.  I-I might take another half.  You want a half?  Oh, no.  Come on.

You look like a baby doll found in hurricane rubble.  Aw, I'm your baby doll.  - (KNOCKING) - I'll get it.  (QUIETLY): Ain't that somethin' to flip your biscuit?  Nothing?  (AUDIENCE MEMBER COUGHS)  Oh, hey, Helen. What are you doing here?  Coming to live with you, like you asked me to at the wedding.  Are-are you watching HBO?  I'm a Christian woman, Brian.  Cancel HBO now.  We can spend the extra money  on the big photos of fetuses I hold  while I yell at people outside Panera."
S17e1,JESS:,"Mom, guess what?  - My farts are back. - (SHORT HIGH-PITCHED FART)  - JESS'S"
S17e1,MOM:,Mine never went away. - (LOW FART)  - (BOTH LAUGH) -
S17e1,JESS:,"Oh, man.  - Uh-huh. - So the crazy ex-girlfriend  - sings this hilarious song. - Uh-huh.  It's all about how she's having her period,  but the other guy she wanted to impress  The one who created the social media app  He walks in while she's singing,  so now he's not into her, either.  Uh-huh.  - Will you get me more salsa? - Uh-huh.  Brian.  Will you get me more salsa?  Huh? Sorry. Got it.  They only had mild.  (GAGGING)  (COUGHING, CHOKING)  Well, I'm sorry it's so disgusting,  but that's all they have.  Oh, you're gonna die if you have to eat mild salsa?  Come on.  (CHOKING)  Wait, are you Oh, my G  Oh, my God, are you choking?  She's Someone I don't  Heimlich maneuver.  How do you do the Heimlich maneuver?  Come on, come on.  Damn it.

That's not an invitation to ruin our moment  to expand your media empire.  (SIGHS)  Son of Zorn.  Ha.  (ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING)  (CRYING)  I'd like to thank you all for coming  to honor the memory of my beloved wife Jess  Uh  I'm sorry, I'm just realizing I never caught her last name.  - JESS'S"
S17e1,MOM:,Schlotz. - Yikes.  It was my husband's name.  What's your maiden name?  Borgwort.
S17e1,PETER:,"That's also bad.  Look, all I want to say is  I always knew this day was coming.  But what I didn't know was  just how much I was gonna miss Jess.  I would give anything  if she were still here with me.  (GASPS)  I'm okay.  It's a miracle!  (SOBBING)"
S17e2,ANNOUNCER:,"Previously, on Family Guy  Hey, who wants to play ""Drink the Beer""?  - Right here. - Heh. You win!  - All right! What do I win? - Another beer!  More recently, and better, on Family Guy"
S17e2,PETER:,"All right, you ready? All right, one, two, three.  - (GRUNTING) - Okay, all right.  - Uh, okay. All right. - Easy, easy, easy, easy.

No, no, no, no. - I I  Other way, other way, you're twisting it the wrong way.  Even more recently, and not quite as good, on  Family Guy  Jess is going to live!    (FARTING)  Brian, did you hear that?  Mm-hmm.  Stewie, I've got to get out of this.  And now, the current, better-than-the-pilot-  but-not-as-good- as-Star-Wars-episode  of Family Guy.  Sorry it took us so long to have dinner together.  Oh, that's okay. You were busy  being dead.  - (HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER) - (BRIAN FAKE-LAUGHING)  Did you warn this guy when he married you  he also married your friends?  - (HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER) - (BRIAN FAKE-LAUGHING)  I love his laugh!  - (HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER) - Ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ah-ha-ha-ha!  Oh, Meg, you have to babysit for Stewie Saturday.  - Nope. - Okay. Chris, you have to do it.  What? That's not fair.  - I have a party to go to. - Sorry, Meg found pictures  on your father's computer, and she's blackmailing us.  She can do what she wants till we get some dirt on her.  I didn't know it was supposed to be hard  before I took the picture.  (WHISTLING A TUNE)  Oh, hey, Peter. Be with you in a sec.  - I'm burning the place down. - You got the bedbugs?  That don't make sense. This isn't the Red Rock Motor Lodge  in Montgomery, Alabama.  Please send the lawsuit to our lawyer,  whose address is below.  That's right, she's also a lawyer.  The mystery deepens.  I don't have bedbugs. I'm burning it down  so I can fake my own death.  Can you throw me that white fur coat  - filled with HoneyBaked hams? - What?  (SOBBING): I just I can't take it, Peter.  I thought I could marry Jess, but it's awful!  I can't live this way!  Hey, relax. You're married now.  You don't have to worry about nothin'.  Everything's done for you.  I mean, I literally don't know where socks come from.  No idea. Do they come from trees?  From bushes? I don't know.  Get a hole in one, new pair shows up  in my drawer, just like that.  Food, too. I chucked the mustard onto the front lawn last week.  That night, back in the fridge.  That would be kind of nice.  Listen, stick with me.  We're gonna have a great adventure,  like the astronaut who thinks the lowest number is three.  MAN (OVER SPEAKERS): And liftoff in five, four,  - three -"
S17e2,ASTRONAUT:,"Whoa!  - two, one - Oh.  - liftoff. - Whoa!  This is our spot, Brian.  A place just for married guys like you and me.  Husbands Restaurant?  I've never seen this place before.  - Is it new? - Nope. Been here for 30 years.  You just can't see it until you get married.  Watch. Take your ring off.  - Wow! - Wearing the ring  also makes you wear giant khaki shorts  with a belt and a lot of keys rattling around in the pockets.  - (KEYS JANGLE) - You're right!  What are all these keys for?  A series of sheds.  I got a lot of sheds back home.  Oh. You have more than one shed?  'Course. You always need an extra shed.  I even got one shed that just has an extra shed in it.  - You guys talking about sheds? - Hell yes. I love my sheds.  - Me, too. - High five on sheds.  Sheds!  (BLEATING LIKE SHEEP): Sheds  sheds sheds sheds  Are those really Tom Arnold's sweatpants in that frame?  Yep. That's the Husbands wall of heroes.  There are a lot of fat guys here.  Well, yeah, Brian. Every man's true weight  is at least 20 pounds heavier than how they look.  You know how much energy it takes to hold all that in?  You can finally let go.  Just relax. Exhale for once.  Exhale like you never have to attract  a pretty woman ever again.  (INHALES)  (EXHALES)  Wow, that feels amazing.  Now, let's order some food. I'm starving.  Nice to meet you, Starving. I'm Brian.  (ELECTRONIC BEEPING)  (PAGER VIBRATES)  Oh, looks like they really want me to come to that party.  - We're gonna have to go. - You you have a pager?  - Yeah. - You get paged?  Yeah, that's how a pager works.  Why don't you just get a phone?  Um, you mean one of your government tracking devices?  No, thanks. I'm using a pager.  ""Oh, you're looking at your steps?""  No, the government's watching where you're going.  It's not nap time, Stewie. Wake up.  All right, we're out of here.  Okay, Stewie's going to the party.  - Yeah, but where's Chris going? - I have no idea!  He's completely off the grid!  Damn it! He can't hide forever.  (BEEPING)  Where are you?  Boy, this really is a high school party.  Complete with the popular kid who's clearly going to die  in a car accident tonight.  Hey, Jagger, can you help out at the soup kitchen  - tomorrow at noon? - Sure. I should be alive then.  Yeah, he gone.  I see we're smoking.  We're not smoking. We're vaping.  - What's the difference? - Smoking is for losers.  Vaping is for douchebags.  Aw. I want to be a douchebag.  Do you own 19 hats?  I only have one, but it's a Stussy hat with a flat brim.  Have a seat.  (INHALES)  Whoo-hoo, it's delightful!  Chris! Chris, isn't this cool?  Stewie, don't say my name! There's an Alexa in here!  Sir, we have eyes on Chris.  He's at a douchebag vaping party.  Sooner or later, they all get sloppy.  (CRUNCHING)  I got to say, Bri, the guys at Husbands  are a little worried about you.  They said you had four  Scott Peterson fish sandwiches yesterday.  Fireball?  No, because I'm not a Skidmore freshman  at a Lake George share-house.  Or am I?  Man, Skidmore's the best!  You said it, Pete. Race you to the raft?  - (LAUGHS) - You're on!  Yeah, let's go!"
S17e2,PETER:,But the water was too shallow.  Bryce broke his neck and never walked again.  This put an end to off-campus drinking  and lake house rentals.  I was just fine.  I landed on Bryce.    JESS'S
S17e2,MOM:,He's starting to smell.  He needs a bath.
S17e2,JESS:,He doesn't like baths.  JESS'S
S17e2,MOM:,"And I see you lost the alcohol argument.  Can't you hear them talking about you?  Yeah. I'm a dog, I can hear everything.  By the way, the Stranger Things monster just farted.  Whew! Must have been that fat chick I ate.  - Time for dinner, guys. - Awesome. I'm starving.  - (LOUD CRACK) - Oh!  Oh  Holy crap! Brian, you okay?  (GRUNTING LOUDLY)  Keep it down up there!  (GRUNTING STOPS)  Holy crap, Hal, what's wrong with you?  (CHUCKLES) You love it.  How does it look, Doc?  I'm sorry to say you have hip dysplasia.  What's that?  I'm not re what dysplasia is, but I do know  you don't often see a ""Y"" that far up in a word.  I took the liberty of X-raying my own hip  to show you what a normal one looks like.  Why does it look like there's a Batmobile in your colon?  Just keep your eyes on the hips.  So, what's the next step?  I was hoping, whenever the Bat-Signal goes up in the sky,  - this thing will just drive out. - Uh, no. For Brian.  Ah. Well, wouldn't hurt to lose some weight.  And he won't be able to walk until his hip heals.  He'll need someone to take care of him.  I'll take care of him.  Like you took care of me when I was sick.  Come back in a week, we can check your pfft-pfft.  What is that?  That's the sound a blood pressure machine makes.  I do impressions for the doctor talent show.  Do you know what this is?  Braaap! Braaap!  An MRI?  Yes! Adding that to my set.  (TOILET FLUSHING)  Oh, my God.  - Where there's smoke, there's - Just me vaping.  Stewie, if Mom and Dad see you with that thing,  they'll kill me.  Get rid of it!  No way. It's awesome. Watch this.  (INHALES)  I'm not good at the football part.  (SNIFFS) It smells like raspberry.  Yeah. It's basically the same as eating fruit.  - Vaping isn't bad for you? - It can't be bad for you  if Stephen Dorff gave up acting for it.  It does seem like they're making it for kids.  This flavor is ""baby formula.""  Let me try.  (INHALES)  Yummy.  Watch this.  (INHALES)  (LAUGHS)  Like the movie The Ring.  Awesome!  (BOTH SCREAM)  Come back here, you.  (SCREAMS)  Giggity, giggity, crabbity, giggity.  (""STUCK IN THE MIDDLE WITH YOU"" BY STEALERS WHEEL PLAYING)  Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you   And I'm wondering what it is I should do   It's so hard to keep this smile from my face   Losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place   Clowns to the left of me   Jokers to the right   Here I am   Stuck in the middle with you   Well, you started out with nothing   And you're proud that you're a self-made man     And your friends, they all come crawling   Slap you on the back and say   Ple-e-e-e-e-ease     Ple-e-e-e-e-ease     Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you   And I'm wondering what it is I should do   It's so hard to keep this smile from my face   Losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place.   E-liquid, please.  Anything that tastes like a Fruit Roll-Up.  Good, all good.  - Good. - All good.  No worries, all good?  - We're good. - Good, all good.  Here you go.  You good? You all good?  - All good here. - Yep, we're good.  Good, all good.  This whole vaping thing was a very smart move.  It tastes great and I don't feel violently ill  as long as some of this vapor is in my lungs.  Plus, when you wake at night shaking  because you haven't had any in three hours,  it's so easy to vape more.  Let's face it, this is the most fun we've had  since Mom got hooked on coffee and bought that Alpuccino maker.  (COFFEE MACHINE, AS AL PACINO): Hoo-ah!  Thank you for having us over for dinner.  Sometimes it's been difficult to cook  with all the other things I have to do for Brian.  Oh, don't listen to her, I'm so easy.  I do have to go to the bathroom, though.  Jess really has been amazing.  (URINATING)  She even set up surgery for me to have my hip fixed.  (URINATING CONTINUES, STOPS)  Uhp, don't get fooled.  (URINATING RESUMES)  I don't know what I'd do without her.  I think I've really found true love.  - (URINATING CONTINUES) - Well, that's lovely.  You know, I don't think we've said grace yet.  -"
S17e2,BRIAN:,"Oh, yeah. - Bless us, oh Lord,  for these thy gifts, which we are about to receive."
S17e2,BRIAN:,"Get out of there, Mountain Dew.  I'm here for Brian Griffin.  Well, this is it, Jess.  See you after my hip surgery.  He won't be needing this anymore.  Thanks.  Good-bye, Brian.  You mean ""see you soon,"" right?  Wait, why won't I need my collar?  (DOGS WHINING)  So, what's this?  Kind of like a pre-op?  Are all these dogs having hip surgery?  Where do you think you are?  This isn't a doctor's office, this is the pound.  You're being euthanized.  What? Jess is having me put down?  Oh, my God, this can't be happening!  Did you also eat a kid?  Look, there's been a horrible mistake.  You've got the wrong dog.  Says right here I got to euthanize Brian Griffin,  and you're him.  You wouldn't kill a singing dog, would you?  Hello, my baby, hello, my honey   Hello, my ragtime gal.   -  - (CASH REGISTER RINGS)    (CROAKS LIKE MICHIGAN J. FROG)"
S17e2,WORKER:,"Oh, now you're getting euthanized for sure.  (INHALES)  (EXHALES)  Hi, honey.  Mommy needs money for scratchers.  What the what kind of brazen thievery is this?  Where'd you get this?  Chris Griffin! You get in here!  What is this?  Um robot penis?  Seriously, I'm absolutely jonesing right now,  so give it back.  I know what this is. I watch Bravo.  - I'm not doing it. - You are too young  - to be doing this. - Maybe it's his and he's just  - too dumb to hide it. - And if that's not bad enough,  you leave it out for Stewie to get his hands on it?  I don't know, Mom, I'm not my brother's keeper.  - He's just a baby. - Babies are stupid like that!  - I'm taking it - (GRUNTS)  and you are grounded, mister.  Now look what you did, you little son of a bitch.  She has my vaporizer.  You have to get it back.  That's your problem.  You lost your vape pen, I didn't lose mine.  Well, I guess you win.  - (GRUNTS) - (GRUNTS, CRIES)  - (GRUNTS) - (GROANS)  - (GRUNTS) - (GROANS)  (GRUNTS)  Hey. (GRUNTS)  (BOTH GRUNTING)  (BOTH SUCKING)  Oh, tastes so good, like skin berries.  I'm alive with pleasure.  (BOTH SUCKING)  It's possible we've taken this too far.  I'll just go down and get yours back.  I will never forget this day.  Mom, I need to talk to you.  Technically, that was not my vape pen,  but I do need it back because it belongs to a friend of mine.  We accidentally switched jackets,  not unlike that episode of The Brady Bunch when Greg  (COUGHS)  Oh, damn it, Chris, why do your lies have to take so damn long?  You're smoking the vape pen?  No, I'm sneaking a real cigarette  like frustrated mothers are supposed to do.  You're such a hypocrite!  At least vaping is healthy.  Oh, don't be an idiot.  Vaping is just as bad, and you look like a douchebag.  No, I don't. I look cool.  Go ahead.  Hold it to your mouth.  Oh, my God, I'm a douchebag.  (INHALES SHARPLY, CRIES)  It's okay, Chris.  Your secret's safe with me.  (PHONE CHIMES)  (KNOCKING ON DOOR)  Hey, what's up, Jess?  I came to see how Brian's  ALPUCCINO"
S17e2,MAKER:,"Hoo-ah!  Sorry, I'm just making an Alpuccino.  Oh.  Well, anyway, I was just wondering  ALPUCCINO"
S17e2,MAKER:,"Hoo-ah!  Sorry, my mom wanted one, too.  Oh, that's-that's fine.  - So is Brian - Can I get you one?  Uh, sure.  Is Brian going to, uh  ALPUCCINO"
S17e2,MAKER:,"Hoo-ah!  When is Brian coming back?  Oh, never.  I'm having him euthanized.  Euthanized?  Oh, my God!    (TIRES SQUEALING)  Come on, come on.  (TIRES SQUEALING)  Euthanize, euthanize, euthanize  Oh, my God!  I got to do something!  Damn it. Now I have to do that with every dictionary here.  Hold on, Brian, hold on.  (DOGS WHINING)  (CAR HORN HONKING)  Don't worry, buddy. I'm on my way.  (DOGS BARKING)  I'm warning you, if you kill me, the Internet's gonna freak out.  (TIRES SQUEAL)  Please, it can't end like this.  There has to be something I can do.  Well, for 200 bucks, I'll strangle you  with my bare hands and stare into your eyes as you die.  What? I'm not paying for that.  I meant I'll pay you.  Stop! That's my dog!  Oh, Peter, thank God.  You got here just in time.  You want to make $200?  I do.  (CHOKING): It's beautiful.  What the hell are you doing here?  Brian, I can explain.  Explain what? How you brought me here to have me killed?  Well, you're no better.  You could have saved my life in the restaurant,  but you let me choke to death.  Okay, fine. I probably could have done more  to save your life.  I was just so unhappy being married, I  I guess I felt letting you Che was my only way out.  God, that sounds awful.  Maybe I did deserve to die.  W-Well, and I should've kept taking care of you,  instead of bringing you here to have you killed.  Maybe I deserve to be with someone who let me die.  Maybe we deserve each other.  It does seem like we're meant for each other.  I mean, gosh, maybe that's what true marriage is  two people who want each other to die.  PETER (CHOKING): Now you're getting it.  So much beauty.  Oh, Brian, I'm sorry that Jess died  during the commercial break,  but it was a very nice funeral service.  Yeah, it's sad.  She was the love of my life, my heart, my  ALPUCCINO"
S17e2,MAKER:,"Hoo-ah!  I took that from her apartment.  So, Chris, I hear you been doing some vaping.  So douchey.  Mom, you told him?  - We had a deal. - Thanks a lot, Peter.  You promised you wouldn't say anything.  Oh, I'm supposed to keep your secret  after you lied to me about sneaking cigarettes?  What the hell, Chris? You told him, too?  - No, I didn't. - Brian told me.  Are you serious, Peter? You said you wouldn't say anything.  I promised Meg I wouldn't tell anyone.  Oh, good job with that, dick.  Chris, the only reason I told him  was he promised he'd keep his mouth shut.  Oh, nice job, Chris.  I should've known not to trust someone  who kisses his own brother.  What? Wh-Who told you that?  - Don't look at me. - Meg told me.  How does it feel, Meg, you frigging town crier?  -"
S17e2,MEG:,You're such a bitch. -
S17e2,PETER:,"She's a bitch?  Meg, you said you wouldn't tell Stewie's secret."
S17e2,CHRIS:,"Stewie, you told Dad?"
S17e2,STEWIE:,I had to get it off my chest.  I didn't think he'd understand me.
S17e2,PETER:,I understand pieces now and then.
S17e3,WOMAN:,"Hudson, time to go.  I got to go home now.  I'm glad I met you, Stewie.  You're neat. Bye.  Bye, Hudson.  I like him.  He's more fun than an Eddie Murphy bed.  And check this out.  (LAUGHS LIKE EDDIE MURPHY)  That's cool. Is it a queen?  Not sure, but people have said it is.  Wait a minute.  This is a self-empowerment seminar.  You lied to me.  You said we were going to Baskin-Robbins.  I said we were going to bask in Robbins' glow.  You know what you did.  I do.  ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.): Ladies and gentlemen,  give it up for Tony Robbins.  (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)    How the (BLEEP) is everyone?"
S17e3,MAN:,"Ooh, he swore. I trust this guy.  All of you here are capable of greatness.  MAN 2: Yay!  But some will never achieve it.  MAN 2: Oh, no!  You, sir.  Come out here.  Sheesh, your head is the size of a picnic watermelon.  Ha! I've been told that.  And you sound like you were lost at sea  and told not to drink seawater but drank seawater.  Peter, will you just listen to him?  Tony, this is why I brought him.  He's never willing to actually confront his issues.  Sounds like you have no self-esteem.  I don't deserve self-esteem.  Peter, I was once a lot like you:  unmotivated, dangerously obese, always relying on cutaways  You know, that reminds me of the time  No, Peter. No more cutaways.  - Stay in the present. - Okay.  Okay. Now tell me what you feel.  Uh, a partial erection.  I don't get touched very often.  You know you deserve a better life, right, Peter?  Yes. Getting hard to breathe in here.  I want to give you that life, Peter.  Time to seize your personal power.  (GASPING)  Yeah, by getting away from you, you weirdo.  But first, here's that cutaway I was gonna do  before you made me skip it.  Only now it'll make no sense.  ""Cast of Parks and Rec Peter"" away!  I can't believe you dragged me to that fraud.  That man has nothing to offer me. (SCREAMS)  (THUNDER RUMBLES)  Tony Robbins.  Listen, I don't have long.  If I get soaked in the rain, I'll be too heavy to move.  Peter, I've seen thousands of people over the years  and helped every single one of them.  I'm not going to let you be my first failure.  I told you, I don't want your help.  (WHEELS SPINNING)  Peter, I swear,  I won't stop trying to help you no matter what.  (THUNDER RUMBLES)  (TONY SCREAMS)  (TIRES SQUEAL)  Oh, my God! Peter, stop the car!  I think he got struck by lightning.  (TIRES SCREECH)  Wait, w-where is he?  He's gone.  This is freaking me out.  Are are you carrying a flask now?  This is about you getting better, not me.  (EXHALES)  Hey, there's Hudson.  (LAUGHS)  Stewie, you're, like, 100 times more advanced than that kid.  Why do you want to hang out with him so badly?  He's just, like, a cool guy.  Hi, Stewie. I'm putting sand on a cat poo.  Cool!  (SIGHS)  I like you, Stewie.  Can I come over for a playdate?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!  Brian, can Hudson come over for a playdate?  Sure, I guess so.  Never heard you ask for a playdate before.  I know, but there's a first time for everything.  Like when I finally built the Leaning Tower of Pisa  out of LEGOS.  I did it!  Mom! Come look! Mom!"
S17e3,LOIS:,"Yeah, be right there, Stewie.  Where's the bush vodka?  (LEAVES RUSTLING)  Where is it? Where is it?!  Ah, there it is.  Hi, Stewbie.  You playing with your kitty cat?  Ah, the privacy of all glass around me.  Finally, I can pick my nose.        TONY (THROUGH CAR): Hey, Peter, next time use a tissue.  - Who said that? - It's me. Tony Robbins.  Tony Robbins?  That's impossible. You're dead."
S17e3,TONY:,"That may be true,  but the lightning bolt that killed me  seems to have magically transferred my personal power  Trademark into your car.  Peter, I told you I was going to help you,  and I'm not leaving until I make good on my promise.  Suit yourself.  Hey, if you're dead, can you ask Bill Paxton  if he's the same as Bill Pullman?  Sure. Hang on.  He said no, but he winked.  Ah!  Hey, Stewie, let's play cops and robbers.  Bang! Bang! Bang! Got you.  (CHUCKLES) Gun?  Oh, that's-that's not that's not a gun.  These are guns.  You're welcome, Paul Hogan.  Any time someone says a weapon is not what it is,  Paul Hogan gets a royalty.  Royalty check, Mr. Hogan.  PAUL"
S17e3,HOGAN:,"Thanks, Jumpy.  Whoa! What are all these for?  Oh, the yoozh:  destroying enemies, world domination.  Oh, and killing my mother.  You want to hurt your mommy?"
S17e3,LOIS:,"Stewie?  Blast! Here she comes.  Well, look at the handsome little boys.  Come downstairs. I made your favorites:  grilled cheese cut to look like a dinosaur.  Ugh. They never look like a dinosaur.  - Your mom seems nice. - She's a slag.  Well, I hope you don't use your guns  to kill your mom or do anything bad.  'Cause if you do,  I won't be able to play with you,  and that's my favorite thing now.  It is?  - Uh-huh. - Mine, too.  You know what? I'm going to let her live.  I must say, I've been evil so long,  I've forgotten what it's like to be kind.  And it's all because of our friendship, Hudson.  - You really mean that? - You bet I do.  And I always tell it like it is,  like when I used to write tombstones.  Complained a lot is what she did.  Stewie, what are you doing?  Having a funeral, Bri.  Say good-bye to Evil Stewie."
S17e3,CHRIS:,"Did we get a pool?  Is this a pool?  Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!  Stewie, slow down, slow down. What happened?  We went to the zoo. We saw an ape.  At first we didn't think we'd see him  'cause he was, like, hiding back in his house.  But then he came out. We saw him!  We saw the ape! He was big.  And then and then and then  And then and then and then  Okay, I get it. You had fun.  Wait, you're not mad I went without you, are you?  No, no, I-I was only going for you.  And maybe to taunt the animals that aren't able to leave.  Which is all of them.  Losers.  All right, you have to take us to lunch,  but first we need to take our nap.  Here's your triple bacon burger and your onion rings.  Ah, crap.  There's only nine pieces of bacon.  I paid for 12.  But I don't wanna make a fuss.  TONY (THROUGH CAR): Peter, listen to yourself.  No one will respect you until you respect yourself first.  Yeah. But I'm a nobody.  You're not a nobody.  Your meal is just as important as anyone else.  You're right.  I'm not a nobody."
S17e3,TONY:,Say it again.  I'm not a nobody!
S17e3,TONY:,"That's the spirit, Peter.  Now yell at that nobody in the window.  You there! I demand more bacon.  Oh, I'm sorry. Here's more bacon.  That's not more bacon  This is more bacon!  Big day, Mr. Hogan.  PAUL"
S17e3,HOGAN:,"Keeping coming, Jumpy!  Here's your Star Wars kids' meal.  Which action figures did we get?  I got Kylo Ren.  I got the role during the two months I was a hot actor,  and now they're stuck with me.  I got Forest Whitaker.  Even as a toy you can't tell where he's looking.  I wish I had the poorly-cast Kylo Ren.  Here, Stewie. You can have mine.  You're giving me the better one?  Why would you do that?  Because you're my friend.  Yes.  You're my friend.  You're my best friend.  Let's choke on these together.  (BOTH GAGGING, CHOKING)  (BOTH PANTING)  That was fun.  Let's switch.  (BOTH GAGGING, CHOKING)  Okay, guys. Time to play ""parachute.""

What's going on? You seem upset.  Oh, you're a you're a real student  of the human condition, aren't you?  Yet, somehow, it escapes your writing.  Whoa! Why are you attacking me?  (SIGHS) I'm sorry, Brian.  Everyone but me got an invite to Hudson's birthday.  I know why this happened.  I called him my best friend too quickly.  Well, maybe it wasn't meant to be.  But, hey, I'm-I'm still your friend.  (AS CLINT EASTWOOD): Yeah, but Hudson isn't.  And that's just something I have to live with.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)  Victory shall be mine.  (THUNDER RUMBLES)  Ha. That's what the baby used to say  when I was your age.  Shut up, Dad. I'm watching Rick and Morty.  So does Mommy have friends over sometimes at night?  Sometimes.  It must be weird having only women come over to see Mommy.  No, it's mostly men.  Oh, it is.  And you'd be comfortable telling that to a judge?  Good morning, family.  My, who's this go-getter?  Tony Robbins has helped me become a better person.  In fact, today, I'm gonna ask for nay, demand a raise.  ""Nay""? Wow.  This new you is a bigger surprise  than when they're making fun of a celebrity  on Saturday Night Live  and the real-life celebrity walks in behind them.  (CHUCKLES) Boy, they're really socking it to this celebrity.  (CHUCKLES) Yeah, can you imagine how mad the celebrity would be?  I mean, wherever they are at this particular moment,  if they're watching, they must be  (BOTH GASP)  Oh. (LAUGHS)  That's the actual celebrity  walking up right behind 'em.  He-he's catching 'em right in the act.  The-The SNL actor doesn't know.  Aw, he's gonna get in trouble.  Look how mad the actual celebrity is.  He's folding his arms and frowning.  He tapped the SNL actor on the shoulder.  Look how surprised the SNL actor is!  Oh! He's completely busted!  (SCREAMS AND LAUGHS) How is this happening?!  (BOTH SCREAMING)  Oh, my God!  I can't believe it!  I was watching upstairs on Hulu!  I saw it on my phone!  My plane has Wi-Fi!  Stewie? Stewie?  ""Quahog Family Fun Zone""?  (DRAMATIC MUSICAL STING)  Uh-oh.  Stewie's dug up all his weapons.  Oh, my God, I've got to stop him.  Go get 'em, tiger.  Hey.  Shut your (BLEEP) mouth.  Tony! You're not gonna believe it.  I demanded a raise just like you told me to  and they gave it to me.  Tony?  Tony? You in there?"
S17e3,TONY:,"Guess who, Peter.  Geena Davis?  No, it's me, Peter. Turn around.  Tony? You're alive?  But how?  I saw you get struck by lightning.  I was created by lightning, Peter,  in a lab, like Frankenstein.  And what do you think about fire?  (ROARS)  Anyway, after the lightning strike,  I climbed into your trunk  and that's where I've been living the past week.  So, whenever I heard your voice, that was just you in the trunk?  That's right.  Why would you go to all that trouble?  Peter, I told you,  I wasn't going to let you be my first failure.  Wow, Tony, I don't know how I can possibly thank you.  You don't need to thank me, Peter.  I have hundreds of millions of dollars.  I keep it in my forehead.  Well, I better be going.  You have a Smart car?  I have two.  I'm coming, broken people!

(SCREAMING)    Stewie?  That's my name, don't wear it out.  Yeah, let that wash over you.  Learned that from a third grader.  Any last words?  Yeah.  I'm glad to see you.  You never RSVP to the invite my mom sent.  You You invited me?"
S17e3,BRIAN:,"Yes. He did.  Brian? What are you doing here?  And how do you know I was invited?  Because  I threw your invitation away.  You what?  I know. I'm sorry.  I-I just I saw how you were connecting with Hudson  and I-I was afraid of losing our friendship.  Friendship?  Brian, you and I have never been friends.  We We haven't?  No. Friends are people  who come in and out of our lives.  But you and I are family.  That's forever.  Sorry I caused all this trouble.  I hope you can forgive me.  Ah, that's okay, nothing could ever come between us.  I'm even going to make a speech at your wedding.  So Brian and I are down in Mexico,  and, as usual, he doesn't have any cash on him.  That's probably why your parents  are paying for all this, right, Evan?"
S17e3,BRIAN:,"Wait, hold on. Evan?  Why am I gay in this?"
S17e3,STEWIE:,"Ah, it's the end of the show.  We sometimes do something silly here.  So, now that you got me back as a friend,  what are all the great things you have planned for us?  Uh we could go see a movie.  Oh, a movie. That's a great idea.  You know what'll get me out of this funk?  The Equalizer 2.  (CHUCKLING) Okay. All right, fine.  I got I got nothing.  Exactly.  And you were such a jealous little bitch  that you had to ruin the one friendship I really cared about.  You're just a big jerk and I hate you,  and there's nothing you can do to make up for it.  Fine.  Maybe I'll just go out and get some ice cream.  Ice cream?  I like ice cream.  Yeah, I don't know. I think it's more of a bigger kid thing.  No, no, no! No. I've had ice cream, like, six times.  All right, come on, let's go.  You know, Brian, I'm starting to think  we're going to get through our Rocky Road.  (BOTH CHUCKLE)  (FORCED LAUGH)  We had a lot of laughs tonight,  but let's remember the important thing:  you can't put a price on your happiness,  which is why I have: it's $6,000.  See you in Fort Myers, probably."

Tiny Tom Cruise?  Oh, hey, little guy. Forgot my sunglasses.  Hey, what's with your gay character names lately?  Stacee Jaxx? Jack Reacher?  I mean, who are you playing next?  (CHUCKLES): All right, try to make this sound gay:  next up, I play Headmaster Bates Mann.  - Anything else? - Actually, yes.  After that, I'll be taking the role of Major Dixon Butts,  then Senator Rod Clutcher.  (AUDIENCE APPLAUSE)  (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)  I'm too small, am I, Brian?

What am I working on?  (CHUCKLES): What am I not working on?  Well, first off, I got this screenplay for Tom Cruise,  about the queen's private secretary, Sir Gaylord Hummer.  Well, actually, he might do that.  But, Brian, I'm more interested in short stories.  (WHIRRING)  (SHOUTS, VOICE PITCH INCREASES)  (FOOTSTEPS RUMBLING)  (ECHOING): Well, hello there, little guy.  (HIGH-PITCHED): What the hell did you do to me, Stewie?  Well, Brian, you seemed to enjoy belittling me,  so I decided to belittle you.  I've simply shrunken down your molecular structure.  It was easy, really.  Like taking candy, or a whistle, from a baby.  You dick. Undo this.  This is perfect.  I think my excitement is best expressed  by Jean-Claude Van Damme in this scene.  (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)  All right, you've made your point. I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I couldn't hear that, it's too high-pitched.  - You're what? - I'm sorry.  - For what? - For calling you a shrimp.  - And? - What do you mean ""and""?  Come on, you know what I want.  And all four chairs  would totally turn for you on The Voice.  - Anything else? - (SIGHS)  And the way you salute and point is very casual  and free of affectation.  Hey, thanks, Bri. I'll go switch you back.  (RAPID FOOTSTEPS)  (SNIFFS)  - (GROWLS) - Stewie!  You know, I'm really flattered you think  all four Voice chairs would turn around.  My dream order would be Adam, Blake,  Alicia Keys, and then Kelly Clarkson,  whose chair I imagine would turn last,  'cause she's, uh she's a bigger gal.  Help!  Oh, crap.  Don't worry, Brian, I'll save you!  But I'm a millennial, so first I have to watch  a YouTube instructional video on how to do it.  What's going on, guys?  I'm Corey, and today I'm gonna teach you  how to get your friend out of a rat hole.  Now, before we get started, don't forget to subscribe  to my channel, Corey's World.  And, guys, I'll get to as many comments as I can,  but I can't get to all of them.  And don't forget to check out my other videos,  like ""How to Play Guitar.""  Uh, Brian, this might be a while.  What's going on, guys? I'm Corey.  Brian! Hang in there, buddy.  BRIAN (HIGH-PITCHED): Hurry up! Get this rat away from me!  I'll shrink myself down and come get you.  But in the meantime, they say  if you put your finger in a rat's butt, that disables it.  (RAT SCREECHES)"

(SQUISHES)  Please tell me that's not the finger  you stuck in a rat's butt.  No. It I don't-I don't remember which one it was.  Yeah, that was the finger.  All right, let's get back to the machine.  Look at all this shag carpet.  This is like our Vietnam movie.  (SOUTHERN ACCENT): I miss Jenny.  - What is that? - That's Forrest. Forrest Gump.  - Yeah, I-I don't think so. - Shh.  - (DISTANT MECHANICAL HUMMING) - What is that?  It ain't a box of chocolates.  (WHIRRING)  (NORMAL VOICE): Vacuum cleaner!

Dude, dude, you got to get down here, by the big trash can.  Dude, dude, dude, just get here.  (BEE BUZZING)  - Brian, we've got to get up to my room. - Yeah, but how?  We'll just climb the lattice on the front of the house.  - When did we get that? - Well, every '80s movie had one,  so the fat man thought we should have one, too.  Wow. Okay, great.  You know, it's funny, you said ""every '80s movie,""  but I can't think of a single one.  - Ferris Bueller's Day Off? - I don't think so.  But the lattice thing sounded right when you said it.  I-I feel like '80s movies were wall-to-wall lattices.  - Sixteen Candles? - Hmm no, no.  I mean, she was being ignored most of the movie.  Who'd be climbing into her window?  Ah, good point. Risky Business?  No. Hookers don't climb.  Oh, I know, Home Alone.  Home Alone must've had a lattice.  Maybe, but that was 1990.  Eh, it feels like an '80s movie.  You know, it was probably greenlit in the '80s,  when lattices were still a thing.  Oh, wow, here we are.  All right, Brian, at this size, this is a two-man job.  While I adjust the settings, you go over there  and hit the tiny button to fire it up.  (WHIRRING)  Wait a minute.  This doesn't feel right. What button did you hit?  That one. The tiny button."
S17e4,STEWIE:,"Wait, did you hit the tiny button  or the button that says ""tiny""?  I hit the button that says ""tiny.""  - You said, ""Hit the tiny button."" - Exactly!  I didn't say, ""Hit the big button that says 'tiny, '""  I said, ""hit the tiny button.""  The one you pressed is going to shrink us down  to microscopic size!  Well, why would you make the tiny button big?  I had to make it big enough to write ""tiny"" on it!"
S17e4,BRIAN:,"Well, what the hell do we do now?!"
S17e4,STEWIE:,I don't  I-I'm still thinking about that lattice thing.  I want to say Parenthood?

Patrick Stewart!  - Well, what'd you find? - I'll be honest.  I think this is a conversation best had over dinner.  Oh. Okay.  So what's going on with the house?  I don't like talking business at the table.  - Let's just enjoy our wine. - You're right. I'm sorry.  (QUIETLY): Your wife's asleep.  Sometimes she fakes it so I can't hump her,  but this seems legit.  So, uh, shouldn't we talk about what you found at our house?  I don't know. It's so late. I have a crazy idea.  Should we talk about it over a nightcap?  Uh, sure, I guess.  I'm a little chilly.  Oh, well, I-I guess I don't need this.  Sir? Sir, I asked you what you found out about the house.  What? Oh. You're gonna have to tent the house.  All right. Thanks for your work. You're very professional.  Yeah, that's me. Professional.  Always professional.  And alone.

Oh, my God, Peter. Give me that.  This gun is not staying in this house for one more second.  I'm giving it back to my father.  Yeah, it's been a disaster.

And you never should have given it to me.  Are you sure?  I bought it at Anthropologie.  Oh.  Wait a minute, what am I saying?  No. You have to take it back.  I'm not. You're keeping it. It's a gift.  Damn it, Daddy, why won't you just take the gun?  Oh, my God! Daddy!  I'm so sorry.  (GASPS) It can't be too serious.  They haven't done an overhead crane shot yet.  Oh, God!

Daddy's gonna require all our love and support.  Well, you got the right guy for that.  I'm great at supporting people.  On Mad Men, I was Christina Hendricks' bra.

All right, Carter, now we're gonna try and jog your memory  and get you talking with some familiar pictures.  So, I will hold them up and you say what they are.  What? You don't know who this is?  But he's so talented.  Anyone who doesn't know who he is  brings shame on his children and wife.  Peter, come on. We're trying to help Daddy,  not relive our embarrassing loss to Joe and Bonnie in Celebrity.  All right, fine. Next picture.  What? You don't know who he is, either?  Go on, Lois, scream at him that he should know.  This guy was in a movie once.  That means we need to put a fifth head on Mount Rushmore.  Damn it, Peter, you should've known who he is.  Even Joe knew.  Yep, Joe sure did.  Hey, Ansel Elgort and Gemma Arterton  are in a Cary Fukunaga film.  Good for them.  All right, Daddy, I know NCIS is on,  but I want to watch Real Housewives,  unless you tell me not to.  (GRUNTING)  Oh, those two hate each other.  These two have a three-year-old feud  based on an offhanded remark at a charity fashion show.  (GRUNTING)  I'm sure Andy Cohen will explain it all  on Watch What Happens Live after the show.  No! The show itself is bad enough!  We don't need another show explaining what we just saw.  Daddy! You're back.  Please, anything but this show.  We could watch Netflix.  Uh, Cleveland Brown:  You Startin' To See What I'm Sayin'?  So, the president pulls the plug  on an investigation into the president?  You startin' to see what I'm sayin'?  (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)  Since you're doing a little better, Daddy,  I thought you should see where you work.  It might help trigger more memories about your life.  I work here? Wow. This place is huge.  What do we do? Are we nice?  You put pesticides in baby food.  - Aw. - Not only that, your chemical waste  - gave a town cancer. - Yikes.  You burned down the entire Amazon rain forest.  - Whoops - You're the number-one producer  - of whale meat. - Sheesh.  - You dumped lead in drinking water. - Zoinks.  Your oil pipeline moved 12 Native American tribes.  - (WHISTLES) - Your fertilizer plant exploded,  - killing 4,000. - (INHALES SHARPLY)  - You bought Vine and shut it down. - I did what?  - You bought Vine and shut it down. - I did what?  - You bought Vine and shut it down. - I did what?  I'm sorry, Daddy, but you're a very cutthroat businessman.  And maybe worst of all,  you engage in constant, gratuitous animal testing.  Sir, as you requested, we had all the monkeys watch Vikings.  Did they like it? Do they think it's worth  - me putting in the time? - Uh, no.  - They didn't care for it. - Good.  This is valuable information.  Now have them watch Sarah Jessica Parker  and Thomas Haden Church in Divorce.  Sir, they've just watched 66 consecutive hours of Vikings.  - If you could - Oh, what, so you want humans  to watch Divorce?  Because if monkeys don't, that's what has to happen.  Wow, I guess I was a cutthroat businessman.  But what about when I wasn't at work?  What did we do together?  Well, sometimes you made me reenact  Kids in the Hall sketches that basically had no endings.  - (MUSICAL STING PLAYS) - (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  But to be honest, we didn't do much.  - Your work always came first. - Really?  And you still took care of me when I was hurt?  I I don't like who I was.  But from now on, I'm going to be a better father and grandfather.  We're going to spend real time together.  Really? Oh, that'd be wonderful.  I haven't been this happy since I went on Safari.  Oh, my God. This is so much faster than Firefox.  (CHUCKLES) All right, let me go to Facebook.  F-A (SIGHS)  It's auto filling ""Fat Butt Rodeo""?  Peter!  You were supposed to stay on Firefox.  Morning, pumpkin. I brought muffins.  You brought pumpkin muffins?  - What? No. Wh-What? - But you said  You know what? Let's try it one more time.  Hey, sweetie pie. I brought muffins.  - You brought sweet pies and muffins? - No.  - (MUSICAL STING PLAYS) - (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  We've already done that.  Damn it, now it's gonna go back outside.  Wow, Daddy, you really meant what you said.  It's been wonderful spending so much quality time with you.  Yeah, Carter. You know, you've always been a real bastard,  but I got to say, it's nice to see you turning things around.  Thanks. You know, you guys made me realize  that I wasted my whole life caring about money,  and I'm not giving up another second.  That's why I've decided  to retire from Pewterschmidt Industries  and give all my money to charity.  Oh, Daddy, that's wonderful.  Yeah, Carter. Good for you.  Thanks. You know, I was a little worried  you guys would be mad about losing your inheritance.  Oh, Daddy, I don't care.  I've seen what wealth's done to you,  and I certainly don't want that to happen to us.  Besides, we're regular people.  We wouldn't miss millions of dollars, right, Peter?  I'm thinking I might.  So, it's weird being Japanese.  Last night, my husband wanted 69.  I said, ""Why do you want beef and broccoli now?""  Hey, that's Chinese.  Look, I know you're upset about losing our inheritance,  but when we got married, the first thing I told you  is I didn't want Daddy's money.  Well, yeah, not now,  but I didn't know you meant forever.  Peter, stop being so selfish.  For the first time in my life, I have a father who's kind  and wants to spend time with me.  And that's more important than any inheritance.  Yeah, well, I still want that money.  It's the only way I can afford that surgery  to turn myself into 100% stained glass.  - I don't get it. - Neither do I.  Oh, my God.  Dad's beautiful.  All right, guys. Now, the way I see it,  Carter's only giving away his money 'cause he's nice now.  So to get our inheritance,  we have to figure out a way to make him mean again.  I don't know, Dad. He seems pretty happy.  Anyone can get mad, Chris. Even Shaquille O'Neal.  Excuse me.  My flapjacks was supposed to have a Superman ""S"" on them.  Are you mad? I I can't tell if you're mad.  Very mad. This is unacceptable.  At's the point of having millions of dollars  if everything can't be Superman?  Okay, well, we'll fix it right away.  Is there anything else I can get you?  Yes. A big ambulance.  I am stuck in this booth.  So, ideas how do we make Carter mean again?  Why don't we hire a prostitute  to bring him almost to completion?  Okay, don't love that my daughter came out of the gates with that.  Why don't we just mix up all the colors of his Play-Doh?  Chris.  Well, you know what gets Gargamel all riled up  is those pesky Smurfs. Maybe there's something there.  Ooh, I know, I know.  Why don't we hire a transvestite to pick him up at a bar,  then take off her wig  at the exact moment of completion?  Yeah, Meg, take it down a notch.  I know what'll make him mad.  Let's get him a book for Christmas.  Didn't I get you all books for Christmas?  Yeah. And now I've got something for you to read, genius.  It's called the room.  Hey, wait, I got something. How do we summon Zuul?  I bet Zuul could help.  Why don't we take him to a truck stop bathroom,  and then after completion, we  Okay, Meg, are you trying to get a rise out of me?  'Cause guess what, young lady?  It worked.  Well, at least I'm saying real ideas  and not just repeating things  I've seen in children's programming.  Yeah, Dad, I kind of agree with Meg.  It seems like you're going for comedy over substance.  I see. Well, then,  I have one last idea how to make Carter mean.  (VOICE BREAKING): Turn him into one of my kids.  (SOBBING)  So, what do you want to do today?  You know, this may be crazy,  but I'd love to finally play piano for you.  Cool, like Alicia Keys.  A piano player named Keys?  - That has to be fake, right? - Yeah, I'd think so.  That's pretty dumb. I mean, if I was in a band,  I wouldn't call myself Carter Guitar.  I know, right?  Actually, I like Carter Guitar.  - I want to be that now. - Hey, I have an idea.  Why don't we do something together?  I'll play, and you sing.  Sounds great. Who's the guy who married a kid  and then later on killed his wife?  - Jerry Lee Lewis. - That's it.  You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain   Something, some-something, something, something insane   Goodness gracious, great balls of fire   (CARTER VOCALIZING)  Y-You don't have to sing the piano part.  I'm playing it.  All right, here's the plan.  I clothespin his balls.  Meg and Chris, you twist his nipples in opposite directions.  I'm glad you came around.  Peter, you may want to take a look at this.  You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain   Oh, my God. Look at them.  This is just what she's been saying she wanted:  to spend time with her dad and for him to love her.  I guess that really is more important than money.  Wow. Dad's really taking this to heart.  Meg. Meg.  Tie my shoe.  Hey, let's do another. How about my karaoke song?  Sure, what-what is it?  The theme to Hill Street Blues.  What? But that doesn't have any lyrics.  The hell it doesn't.

My name is Josh Robert Thompson,  and I perform for scale.  (CHEERING, APPLAUSE)    You're going down, Meg.  - Lacey Chabert?! - That's right.

Mine has whipped cream, so I didn't get it  on the first sip.  Ow!  - (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) -   Thank you.  Um, I-I'm not really good at public speaking,  so I'll just say farble shlup muckle blop.  All right, Meg, I'll take it from here.  Hi. I'm Lois Griffin, Meg's mother.  You may also know me as the lady who threw a plate of cheese  during that city council meeting.

My race isn't for a few days,  so we should have plenty of time to hang out.  Anyone want to grab some food?  Sorry, Meg, I can't.  I'm trying to land you some endorsements,  and I have a lead with a very popular IBS medication.  Quick, say,  ""I never let traveler's diarrhea keep me grounded.""  No!  Well, then you're just handing this thing right to John Kruk!    Oh, my God, Brian, look.  - Who is that? - Oh, that's figure skater  turned flamboyant commentator Johnny Weir.  I wonder where Tara Lipinski is.  I heard they always have to be  within quipping distance of each other.  Oh, she's in the hat!  Isn't she amazing?  I feel like she's my soul mate.  How is she your soul mate?  She looks like a baby,  and she's best friends with a gay guy.  - Her life is my life. - I'm not gay.  Well, it's not me!  Come on, let's go meet them.  Hi. I just had to come over and introduce myself.  My name is Stewie, and I'm a huge fan of you guys.  Oh, it's nice to meet you, Stewie.  Yeah, it's always so nice to meet our fans.  And can I just say, the shape of your head is stunning.  Really? I get a lot of grief for it.  Some people say it looks like a football.  Okay, I don't know what that is, but they're just jealous.  Every one of them.  Remember, nothing normal looks good.  Well, I have to say, you two are the best thing  to happen to sports  since the New York Knicks finally changed their name."

Oh, sounds like something Gandalf says  at the foot of a mountain.  Oksana Baiul!  Okay, we can go in now.  Oh, God, here she comes!  Act like I said something funny.  I don't know, Stewie.  I think the Special Olympics serve an important purpose.  So do I! Who thinks they don't?  I don't know. Ask this guy.  He's a dog. He's just learning how to talk.  So, hey, Tara, are you doing anything later?  I was thinking maybe we could grab dinner or something.  Yeah, sure. You seem cool. That could be fun.  All right then, it's a date.  Oh, I just need to make a call.  I was supposed to help the speed skaters  get their tights over their thighs.  (GRUNTING)  Stewie, it's not gonna fit!  Hey, we can do this.

Oh, hey, Stewie, how's it going?  Terrible. Johnny Weir's making my life a nightmare.  I really thought I had a shot with Tara Lipinski,  and he ruined it.  I'm sorry to hear that.

S18e2,MAN:,"Hello? Room service.  I've got your eggs and Snausages.  Snausages.  Table 13. The fish is for the gentleman,  and the chicken is for the lady.  Got it.  Great. Is that our food?"
S18e2,WAITER:,"The fish is for the gentleman,  and the chicken is for the lady.  I'll be right back, folks.  Well, thanks for picking me to break in  your new Discover card with.  Hey, thanks for co-signing for it.  My pleasure.  (YAWNING)  Brian, I can't help but notice  you're a little uncomfortable spending time with me.  I thought you said you weren't ashamed of me.  What are you talking about?  Because I made you lie down in the back seat  all the way here? You looked tired.  It just seems like you're always taking me  to out-of-the-way places to avoid being seen together.  - Like yesterday. - Come on, that's not true.  I just wanted to show you a beautiful view.  Wow, check out that big blue marble.  Look, there's another shuttle.  - Get away from the window! - (GROANS)  Okay, maybe, maybe this has been  a little weirder for me than I thought.  I'm sorry, Ida. I  I really care about you and you deserve better.  - Can I help you? - The fish is for  The fish is for me. And the chicken  the chicken is for my girlfriend, Ida Davis.  ""Girlfriend""? Are you sure, Brian?  I'm sure.  And from now on, I'm not hiding anything.  Like Peter and his formaldehyde jars.  - Peter? - Yes?  Is this is about my work?  Hi, I have a Styrofoam cooler with weird tape on it?  Ah, that must be the cat brains and baby bodies.  Are you making people?  (LAUGHS): He'll be flattered you called him that.  (CACKLES)  (CLEARS THROAT) Hello, everybody.  I have some pretty big news.  - It may come as a surprise, but - It's about Ida, isn't it?  It has to be. Why else would Ida be in our house?  Meg's right. I-Ida's only been here, what,  - like, twice her whole life? - You think they did it again?  - Well, what else could it be? - They do have a lot in common.  Two mature people with dwindling options.  Like, I know Brian was squeamish about sleeping  with a trans woman before, but it's 2019 now.  Yeah, things that were gross five years ago are now heroic.  Wow. Brian and Ida. Good for them.  Well, that's a relief.  Now the only other person we have to tell about us is Glenn.  Oh, God, I haven't even thought about that.  Mr. Quagmire hates Brian.  Yes, my big brother's right.  Quagmire thinks Brian's trash.  Well, just have him over here for dinner.  We'll help you. We're here for you, Brian.  You know what? You're right. I can do this.  After all, I'm not the first person to deliver tough news.  Like when they found Waldo.  There are many things I can't go into at this time,  but I can confirm that a body was removed  from Waldo's apartment this morning."
S18e2,REPORTER:,"Is this being treated as a suicide?  Again, I can't confirm.  But to that point, instead of always asking ""Where's Waldo?""  maybe some of you should've been asking ""How's Waldo?""  Good day.  Glenn, Ida, it's so nice  that you could both come over for dinner.  Thanks so much for having us.  (PHONE VIBRATES)  No response from Peter. What the hell?  I thought we were going to the Clam.  And Quagmire just texted back ""Can't.""  I don't like it.  They're doing something without us.  So, Brian, what's, uh, what's new in your world?  (CLEARS THROAT) Oh, well, um,  thank you for asking, Lois.  - I see them. - They're both in there.  Looks like a dinner party!  Uh, actually, I have some news that happens to pertain  - to my dating life. - Really, Brian?  - Oh, do tell us. - I knew it!  Well, it's kind of big news.  Those scalloped potatoes?  Well, what's the big news?  Go ahead, Brian. Tell him.  Ida and I  have, uh  begun dating.  You're, you're joking, right?  It's true, son. Brian and I are in love.  What?! When were you gonna tell me this?  - (PHONE CHIMES) - Oh, Peter just texted.  He says he's stuck at work.  (SIGHS) They are working that poor man to death.  I'm so glad you dropped in. Brian is cooking breakfast.  That's right, get ready for Eggs a la Brian.  Scrambled eggs with a side of toast.  What? How is that ""a la Brian""? That, that's just  That's, that's great. That's just great, Brian.  I am very excited for this unique breakfast.  Cool, cool. How many globs of ketchup do you want?  Uh, chef's choice.  So, um, how long has this been going on, Dad?  Listen, Glenn, I know this is an adjustment for you,  and you and Brian haven't always seen eye to eye.  Well, I wouldn't say that.  He's just, uh, kind of a big personality. (CHUCKLES)  So, Denver Airport.  Kind of up there, huh? Mile-high.  Yeah, that is the height of the airport.  Now, O'Hare Airport, why on the ticket is it ""ORD""?  Uh, it was originally called Orchard Field.  Really? Huh.  Uh, so why is Wilkes-Barre/Scranton ""AVP""?  I'm not gonna go through every airport with you, Brian.  You know, Glenn, Brian thought you two could hang out  this afternoon, and I think that's a great idea.  Yeah, Quagmire, what do you say?  (SHUDDERING)  All right. I guess I can do that.  - Well, great. - (OVEN TIMER CHIMES)  Oh, the ketchup's hot.  Everyone goes cold, I go hot.  And that's the ""a la.""  This sucks. I don't want to be here.  Come on, Glenn. If I'm gonna be dating your mom,  it's important that we spend some time together.  Hi, we have two guest passes from a museum member, Ida Davis.  I'm not seeing an ""Ida Davis.""  (QUIETLY): Uh, try ""Dan Quagmire.""  - ""Lieutenant Dan Quagmire."" - Ah, the lieutenant.  And how's he doing? Still have his penis?  No, he doesn't.  And that's a weird question to ask.  I'm a weird guy, I work at a museum.  See? It's not so bad.  It's like Night at the Museum in here.  - How? - Well, you know,  like, the guys are gonna come to life.  - Like, who? - Um, the guys, you know?  When it's, when it's nighttime.  - You didn't see the movie, did you? - No.  Why did you bring up a reference to something  you know nothing about?  I it just, it reminded me of, uh  Brian, don't bring up a reference to someone  whose favorite movie it is,  because you'll just embarrass yourself.  That was a natural history museum,  this is a science museum.  What, you think this tidal chart's gonna come to life?  You think this moon rock is gonna walk across the room  and riff brilliantly like Robin Williams  playing Teddy Roosevelt, God rest both their souls?  Be very, very careful treading around Night at the Museum.  Okay, let's get this game started.  - Do you believe it still fits? - From when?  Thank you for throwing this barbecue.  It's so good for the boys to spend real time together.  Okay, let's play. Kids versus the parents.  All right, we're gonna destroy those kids.  Uhp, someone's on the wrong team.  Boy, they're in such a hurry not to be kids anymore.  Your time will come, trust me.  I'm older than the adults. I'm older than all of you!  It seems like that sometimes, I bet.  - Get down there, champ. - (SIGHS)  All right, as the one adult on a team full of children,  I'm gonna act good-natured  while being subtly furious at all your mistakes.  Okay? Break on three.  One, two, three  - Break! - Football!  Let's focus, Chris. Can we just focus for a minute?  And let's all face the same direction.  Okay, I'm gonna call the plays  while I'm covering my mouth with this play card.  Peter, that's not a play card, it's a Denny's menu.  Let's run Moons Over My Hammy on three.  Hey, guys? Gonna need your help over here.  They got a real All-American at QB.  (QUIETLY): God.  Down. Hut! Hut!  Good hutting, Glenn. That's my boy, hutting.  Way to hut!  Shut up. Stop complimenting things that don't need it.  Hike!  Uh-oh, look who's on the loose.  I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you  Oh, no, I missed you by total accident.  Yeah! Six points, bitches.  (CHUCKLES): Whoa, that was some great move, buddy.  - (DINGS) - Aw.  Did you see and hear the wink?  That means he did it on purpose.  No, no, way. He did it all by himself.  (DINGS)  Ah! There it is again!  Brian, you're the best dad ever.  What're you talking about? I beat him.  I wish I had a dad like that.  Me, too, bud.  Brian, you're very sweet to do that.  To do what? I'm the one who scored the touchdown.  - You sure did, Glenn. - He's not my dad!  I already have a dad, and it's my mom! All right, Brian?  Stop trying to be my dad, you fraud.  Glenn, sweetie, calm down.  No, I'm not gonna calm down. I can't take this anymore.  Listen, Dad, the first time you hooked up with Brian,  it was awful, I hated it.  But you were confused, you'd just gone through a huge change,  you didn't know if you had any options, so you settled.  But you're a beautiful, intelligent woman.  And now you've had time to adjust and your choice is Brian?  Why in God almighty would you choose him?  ""Because I love him,"" a resolved Ida said.  - I'm also a published author. - Self-published.  You're also a pompous, pretentious,  hypocritical blowhard.  - Who attended Brown. - For one semester.  - You went to Brown? - For two months.  See? See, that's what I mean.  His whole life is a lie.  I can't take this anymore. It's either him or me.  - I choose Brian - Yes.  To talk to first.  Brian, I've loved every minute that we've spent together.  I never thought I'd meet someone  who I connected with on so many levels,  - much less an Ivy Leaguer. - Come on  But as special as you are to me, I have to put my son first.  - But Ida - He's my son.  I've made my decision.  Bye-bye, Brian. You're history.  And this time, history's not coming back to life.  Night at the Museum.  I'm sorry, Brian.  I'll never forget what we had together.  I understand.  Can you guys wrap this up?  I see Peter coming with some kind of problem from the game.  (CRYING): Quagmire, we agreed that it was a two-hand touch,  and then Chris hit me with one hand,  and I said that didn't count,  but he still wouldn't count the touchdown.  So I drilled him in the head with the ball,  and now he's not moving.  He can blink his eyes, but nothing else.  - So, is my dog still your dad? - Uh, no.  Chris, he said the touchdown counts!

S18e3,ANNOUNCER:,"Mueslix, the weird European cereal  that likes to watch you poop.  (DOORBELL RINGS)  Aw, why we got to stay with your parents?  You know, sometimes I get the feeling  they don't respect me.  (GRUNTING)  (BRAKES HISS)  (WHIRRING)  Thank you for not interrupting my bit.  Come on in.  Wow, check out this media room.  Maybe you burning down the house wasn't so bad.  My actions were justified.  I'd been fed a massive societal lie  in the form of participant awards.  Hey, kids, how would you like to hear this on the screen  instead of the great show you came to see?  (CHILDREN CHEERING)  That's what you sound like. Honest.  Please cooperate and do your part  in keeping this theater quiet, so everyone,  including you, can enjoy it.  Remember, lots of adults and kids, too,  paid admission to enjoy the show.  We must insist on absolute quiet.  Otherwise, we will be forced to evict  all disturbance makers from the theater.  Those asked to leave today will be refused admission  to this theater in the future.  Thank you.  Wow, what a dick.  Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.  I've deleted all my old tweets,  so don't even bother looking for bad stuff.  Screen grabs can be faked.  But, first, it's that time of year again  for the annual Quahog Pie Cook-off.  The winner will take home the coveted Pie Champ trophy.  Brian, this could be my chance to finally win  a legitimate award.  - You think you're up to it? - Of course.  I just have to apply myself.  Like Chris, when he worked at that casino.  No more bets. The money that could have gone to your kids  is gone. No more bets.  The money you worked hard for is gone.  Fools, fools, fools.  Ooh, double zero. Nobody thinks about that one.  And guy walks quickly away from table without a word,  replaced by an older white man with a much younger black woman.  No more bets. No more bets.  Brian, are you ready for my grand creation?  - Serve it up, bitch. - Well, that was uncalled for.  But get ready to be wowed.  (CRUNCH)  What the This is mud.  Yes. It's a mud pie.  I used Legos for the fruit.  Stewie, you can't submit this. It's inedible.  Okay, now I know you're full of crap,  because everyone else loves it.  Mmm, num-num-num-num-nah.  So delicious, Stewie.  Best pie ever.  Wow! Tastes great, Stewie.  Mmm, so good.  Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.  Not so hammy, Meg. He's not an idiot.  Stewie, can't you see they're faking it  to make you feel good?  What are you talking about?  (SLO-MO): Wow!  Mmm. Num-num-num-num-nah.  So good.  We must insist on absolute quiet.  My God, you're right.  They're all just lying to protect my feelings.  This pie is garbage!  And the contest is next week. I have to drop out.  No, you don't. You just got to do the work.  Stewie, you're a smart kid.  I know you can bake a pie, and I'll help you.  You will? Thank you, Brian.  This calls for champagne.  Pop.  Glug, glug, glug.  Bottoms up.  Go with it.  Ugh. Korbel?  - It's not Korbel. It's - Go with it.  Yes, I had some left over from Denise's wedding.  - Who's Denise? - Go with it.  Fine. How is Denise? Did she have the abortion?  - Abortion? - Go with it.  No, her alarm didn't go off, so she missed it.  So, Brian, is this your first orgy?  Not going with it.  Peter, would you like to join us in a parlor game?  Parlor game?  Lois, why do you always start talking like a snob  when you're around your parents?  What? It's the way I was brought up.  I know, let's play ""The Minister's Cat.""  I don't know what that is.  It's simple. In alphabetical order. Go.  The minister's cat is an affable cat.  The minister's cat is a boisterous cat.  Penrose!  The minister's cat is a covetous cat.  The minister's cat is a devious cat.  The minister's cat's an eclectic cat.  Peter, your turn. Go.  - Wh-What? - Peter, hurry.  I don't I don't know this cat.  Damn it, Peter, you ruined the game!  Peter, perhaps the word you were looking for is  ""forgotten.""  Midnight   Not a sound from the pavement   Has the moon lost her memory?   She is smiling alone.   You kids are too young to remember that,  but your parents are gonna hate it.  (CRICKETS CHIRPING)  (SIGHS): Finally, a place to escape.  Oh, hey, Babs.  Hello, Peter. What brings you out here?  I had to get away from that stupid game.  I don't know, whenever I'm here, I feel out of place.  It's just a different world than I'm used to.  (BELCHES)  Bring that up again, and we'll vote on it.  Whoa, where'd you learn a line like that?  Oh, there's a lot you don't know about me.  You know, Peter, you and I are not so different.  You struggle to get erections, too?  You may think I've always been a part of this high-society world,  but I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth.  Well, that probably would've torn your mom's uterus.  My point is, I'm not from an upper-crust world, either.  I just had to act that way to impress Carter,  who cared about that stuff.  I was struggling to be something I wasn't.  In many ways, I still am.  There's an Ed Sheeran song  for every emotion you're feeling right now.  Ooh, no, thank you.  You know, I like hanging out with you.  Hey, what do you say we ditch this stuffy place  - and head to the Clam? - The Drunken Clam?  Why, I haven't been there in decades.  I'd love to.  - To the Babsmobile! - (ALARM CHIRPS)  (""BATMAN THEME"" PLAYING)  You got vehicles with your face on 'em, too?  You know it, stinky.  Oh, I didn't like being called stinky.  (TIRES SCREECH)  Babs, I got to hand it to you.  You turned a crappy night into something great.  You know, I've never dropped bowling balls  from an overpass before. They fall quick.  That was the most fun I've had in decades.  It felt good to reconnect with the girl I once was.  Hey, listen, you got to stay true to that girl.  She's an amazing person. A real person.  Not some stuffy Newport snob.  Oh, sometimes I feel trapped in this world,  forever trying to live up to everyone else's expectations,  especially Carter's.  Sounds like you've wasted your entire life.  Thank you, Peter.  You've helped me more than you know. Mwah.  Yuck.  Well, Brian, I've studied pie-making,  and the key is to find the absolute freshest ingredients.  Therefore, we must go wherever and whenever  they're to be found.  - Where are we? - 1666, England.  Home of Sir Isaac Newton  and one of history's most famous apples.  Which will be part of our pie.  (SHOUTS) Gravity never happened!  Good morning, family.  And before anyone asks, I brought this owl from home.  I did not take it from the enclosed owlery.  Just want to make that clear. Home-brought owl.  Peter, what did the two of you talk about last night?  - (HOOTS) - Yeah, who?  You can see why I stole this from the owlery  I-I mean brought it from home. Damn it!  My mother. After your night together,  she told Daddy she's leaving him.  - (HOOTS) - Yeah, who?  All right, I'm already getting tired of this owl.  I'm gonna go put him back in the owlery.  Peter, enough. You've got to make this right.  Now, that one seemed less earned.  (SEABIRDS CALLING)  (TIRES SCREECH)  Babs, I've been looking all over for you.  - What are you doing here? - This is my hometown, Peter.  It's where I grew up.  In fact, as a rebellious teen,  I used to come down to this boardwalk  and feed Alka-Seltzer tablets to the seagulls.  (SQUAWKING)  Babs, you got to come home. Carter needs you.  I'm sorry, but I-I can't do that right now.  (SEAGULL SHRIEKS, POPS)  Peter, you've been able to stay true to who you were.  - I've lost touch with that. - (SEAGULL SHRIEKS, POPS)  It's been buried by Carter and his money.  I want to find it again.  Listen, Babs, I understand what you're doing. I really do.  Sometimes I feel suffocated by Lois  and my stupid mother-in-law, but you got to come home.  - (SEAGULL SHRIEKS, POPS) - I don't think so, Peter.  You and Carter are meant for each other.  You go together.  L-Like the couple from the movie Grease.  Mr. Rama-Lama-Lama-Ka-Dinga- Da-Dinga-Dong, do you take  Miss Shoo-Bop-Sha-Wadda- Wadda-Yippity-Boom-De-Boom  - to be your wife? - I do.  And Miss Shoo-Bop-Sha-Wadda- Wadda-Yippity-Boom-De-Boom,  do you take Mr. Rama-Lama-Lama- Ka-Dinga-Da-Dinga-Dong  - to be your husband? - I do.  If anyone objects to this union,  speak now or forever hold your peace.  (ALL GASPING)  Mr. Chang-Chang-Changity-Chang-Sha-Bop!  Peter, where have you been?  Listen, Carter, unless you want to lose Babs forever,  you better get down to Weekapaug.  Why the hell would I do that?  If you want to win her back,  maybe, for once, you try to fit into her world.  You got to become a regular guy.  What? No! Never!  Daddy, Peter's right. You got to do this for Mom.  All right, fine. I'll take a quick choke-myself-awake nap  and be ready to go.  (SNORING)  (CHOKING)  (CLEARS THROAT) All right. All right, let's go.  - I'm so nervous. - You made a damn good pie, Stewie.  You should be proud of yourself, whatever happens.  Good afternoon, Quahog, I'm Tom Tucker in a T-shirt?  And now, the moment you've all been waiting for.  This year's Quahog pie-baking champion is  Fjurg Vanderploeg.  (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  Everyone is welcome to taste my pie.  Sorry, Stewie. You did your best.  These were old pros.  But, hey, look. You took fifth.  Fifth? Is that good?  - Do I get a medal? - You get a ribbon.  Does everyone who participates get a ribbon?  Only ten out of 14.  My God. I did it.  No, Stewie, you did it  Oh, wait. Sorry, I thought you  - I thought you said ""we did it."" - I did not.  Good job, little boy.  Maybe someday you can come by my store  and have all the cake you want.  - Ooh, that sounds promising. - Okay, that's enough.  And maybe this winter, you can go fishing in my ice hole."

And while we're at it, give me that pool cue.  I got an idea where we can put it.  - Peter, shut up. - Carter? Is that you?  Oh. Hey, Babs. I hang out here all the time.  Yeah. He comes in here with me.  And I'd even take a lie detector test to prove it.  Well, good thing the bar is having Lie Detector Wednesday.  Wh-What?  Just a few easy warm-up questions.  Have you ever had condomless sex with a man?  Okay, test over. Carter's never been here in his life.  Damn it, Peter. I'm leaving.  (CREAKING)  - (GASPING) - My truck!  Time to waste this fancy-pants.    (GRUNTS)  Babs, you saved me.  And the bartender's unconscious.  Let's take his pants down, see what he's working with.  (CHEERING)  (CRYING): Babs, I'm sorry.  I tried, but I can't do it.  I'll never be the real man you want me to be.  I'll always be just a spoiled, spineless, rich dandy.  Carter, I appreciate you trying to be the man I want,  but being back home here has made me realize  you already are.  What? I am?  I've discovered I'm not the same girl I once was.  I've changed.  I've grown accustomed to life with you.  I thought I wanted this life back,  but have you ever had a Milwaukee's Best?  It's an awful, awful, awful  - It's one of our sponsors. - Delicious beer,  but, still, ours is the life I want,  and you are the man I want.  Newport is my home now, and I'm ready to go back there.  Oh, Babs.  (MOANING)  Ah, old love.  (CREAKING)  Well, I didn't pay for my beer, but I left a hell of a tip.  (LAUGHTER)  Damn it, Griffin! You've been staring at that menu  for 22 minutes, and now you're sitting in a double pee puddle!  Peter, I'm so relieved  that my mother's back with my dad.  Yep. It all worked out.  Only one thing left to do.  Get drunk, go upstairs and weird out the kids.  (QUIETLY): Chris.  Are-are you awake?  Chris, you do you want a You want a Tom Brady kiss?  Chris, wake up.

The show is from a woman's perspective,  but it still felt like it was written by a man.  Okay, well, what if I told you shut up?  Yeah, kind of changes things, doesn't it?  Anyone else?  I'm sorry, I was scrolling through the weather  in random cities.  Great! You're taking this very seriously.  You know what, I don't really get Family Guy.  What's so hard to get?  You just need to have grown up in the '80s  but still be a teenager.  So, based on that one episode featuring Lois,  how many of you would likely watch a second?"
S18e4,LOIS:,"Son of a bitch!  Anything else?  Huh, 76 in Santa Fe right now.  Hey, what's going on in that room?  It's a focus group of Arby's executives  watching us eat.  - Oh! - No way!  - He ate it! - People will eat anything!  50 bucks says the fat girl eats  a third Big Beef 'n Cheddar. Who's on it?  - Okay. - I'll take that. -You got it.  - Oh, come on, buddy. - Don't do it.  Here she comes.  All right, kid, take your time.  - Yeah! - Gross! -Damn it!  Many recent shows have found success  by rebooting themselves as gritty supernatural teen dramas,  like Teen Wolf or Riverdale,  which are watched by as many as 6,000 people a year,  so we thought a similar approach might work for Family Guy.  I'm guessing we're wrong, but let's find out for sure.  (SLOW, DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)  FEMALE"

Dad, what are you doing here?  Putting my gender fluid in the shower.  Also, I'm the town sheriff,  but you don't find that out till later  because it's not relevant to the story.  Chris, there you are.  Patty, what's wrong? Why aren't you in bitch class?  It's your sister Meg.  She's dead.  (GASPS) I have to go.  Wait, where are you going?  I'm gonna go to a club I'm too young to get into  and listen to a band that's on a label  owned by the same parent company as the network.  Hey, who left their gender fluid in the shower?

Glendale Galleria Public.  Yeah, that's what I've been trying.  Sometimes networks will cancel a show  only to reboot it with less-popular characters  from the original, while the more-popular actors go on  to find greater success in movies or ugly public divorces.

Ah, the general had a sweet tooth, huh?  Um, that was horrible.  Eh, I'm gonna tweeze the Skittle out  and go back in a week.  I like those Netflix stand-up specials.  Great.

Pull over by this hot guy and let me out.  I thought I read you guys were phasing out gay jokes.  That quote was taken out of context  and widely misunderstood.  All right, what's next, you sheep?

It means Family Guy is just fine as it is.  (CHEERING)  Well, the Family Guy reboot is off.  What other ideas do we have?  (CHITTERING)  Brooklyn Nine-Ten?  It's possible this guy only has one idea.

I've told you about my worst nightmare, right?  - No, I-I don't think so. - Oh, boy, get comfortable.  Well, first, I'm driving through a forest,  but it's actually inside, which is weird, right?  - Okay. - And there's all these people  in the van who normally wouldn't know each other in real life:  my second grade teacher, my mom, Joe, but it wasn't quite Joe.  All the kids are yelling at me in German,  and I understood them, but I don't speak German.  Then SNL is starting, and I'm clearly in the cast,  and I haven't been to any of the rehearsals,  and all the cue cards are blank, and that show is all cue cards.  And just as that's sinking in,  I realize I'm also the musical guest.  I mean, I can't pull that off.  Who do I think I am? Silverchair?  - And the weird thing is - Wait a minute.  Listening to other people's nightmares  is my worst nightmare!  (SHOUTS) Oh. Oh, thank God.  (EXHALES)  I got to shut down that cat place.

Let's call them what they are: Iranian cats.  This entire operation needs to be shut down.  And as long as Brian's got your attention,  is it taking anyone else longer to wipe?  More wipes these days?  I'm taking shorter poops but with longer wipes,  and there's always this one little line.  I swear to God, it's like there's a crayon down there.

Tom, I'm standing here outside of Quahog's new cat cafÃ©.  Local resident Brian Griffin has described the cafÃ©  as a threat to public health.  That's right, Tricia. And since I'm on local TV,  (LOUDER): I'm gonna talk a little too loud,  and then occasionally I'm gonna turn away  (QUIETER): from the microphone to point at things off-camera,  (LOUDER): so my overall point is lost.

Okay, Brian, I brought everything we need:  water, sunscreen, (QUIETLY): Fruit Roll-Ups,  - batteries. - Stewie,  you know you're not allowed to have Fruit Roll-Ups.  Damn, I tried to bury it in there.  What are you even wearing?  Oh, this is what Princess Diana wore to protest land mines.  It's sad she's not around to watch her son go bald.  Brian, I'm glad you're here.  Based on the various public health concerns you raised,  the city has decided to shut this establishment down.  Really? You're closing the cafÃ©?  That's right. Thanks to you, I'm out of business.  I certainly hope you're happ Oh, nice top, Stewie.  Come on, lock it up.  Until the Board of Health gives the okay, you're done.  Wow, I actually got the place shut down.  I'm glad I was here for this, Brian.  We've hardly done anything together since we made  that fiber commercial and had to use code words for pooping.  Wow, Brian, I've never felt so regular.  Yes, you seem exceptionally active while maintaining  - proper body health. - That's right.  Just two spoonfuls a day to stay regular and active.  - More coffee, Stewie? - Yes, please.  Oh, dear, that was a mistake.  (STAMMERS) You mean, you're about to be active?  Currently active.

Remember, history says that Jesus does not look like  a traditional man from the Middle East,  but rather someone who sells raw milk online.  Okay, let's put those away for now.  I'd like to move on to having you all  sign your contracts with God.  Contracts with God?  Yep. It's a written commitment to forgo all alcohol,  drugs and self-pleasure.  Yeah, I'm gonna have my lawyer look at this.  I tell you, it's a good day, Stewie.  Now that that cat cafÃ© is gone, I can finally get back  to my favorite bar and do some writing.  Whoa, sorry. Can't let you in there.  What? I come in here all the time.  Well, apparently, due to some recent public health concerns,  the city has said that no animals of any kind are allowed  in any public establishment.  What?! You got to be kidding me!

Got plenty of company.  Well, that's good. I haven't seen you at the Clam.  Well, I've been pretty busy.  So, can I get you something to drink?  Sure. What have you got?  Well, I've got water with cat hair in it.  Eh, anything else?  I've got lemonade with cat hair in it.  Uh, kind of a summer drink. Anything else?  Oh, sure.

When have we ever been to a mountain?!  - What mountain even is it? - That's Mount Quahog.  Yeah I don't know, feels made up.  Brian, is this all because you haven't been able  - to get a drink? - I haven't been able to go anywhere.  No dogs allowed in public places.  Yes, I was thinking about that.  What if there was a way for you to go out?  ""Emotional support animal""?  Wear this, every place will have to let you in.  - So long as I'm with you. - Where'd you even get that thing?  The letters are iron-on.  The vest is from when I worked at Office Depot.  One pen? You're buying one pen?  Yep.  You don't work in an office you can steal this from?  I work from home.  - Ugh. - (BEEPING)"

My ex-husband had Nazi paraphernalia and he left me.  So I said, ""That shirt looks really good on you,""  and he says, ""Thanks, my boyfriend got it for me.""  It's like, whoa, all I said was I like the shirt,  and he has to drop ""boyfriend"" like a nuclear bomb?  - I mean, that's on him, right? - Yeah. I don't know.  Ugh, you're supposed to be giving me emotional support right now.  Let's just get to the bar.  No, no, Brian, say something nice about me right now.  Come on, Stewie, that's not what this is.  It is now. Say something nice about me  or I'll disappear like a serial killer in a '90s movie.  Stewie, wait. I need you to get in.  I'm gonna do it.

There was something in the air that night   The stars were bright, Fernando   They were shinin' there for you and me   For liberty, Fernando   Though we never thought that we could lose   There's no regret.   (OWL HOOTS)  Ugh. Good riddance, Christian family camp.  Totally. I will say, though,  it seemed like Chris enjoyed himself there.  Well, Meg, you know Chris is (QUIETLY): a little bit dumb,  and I know you're not particularly popular  or beautiful, but you do have a head on your shoulders.  So religion isn't gonna be for people like you and me.  It's basically for (QUIETLY): stupid people like Chris.  So to summarize, religion for you and me?  No good. But for (QUIETLY): idiots like Chris?  - Perfect. - What are you guys talking about?  - How handsome you are. - Really?  Swear to God.  You're a monster.  (CRICKETS CHIRPING)  (MUTTERS) Stupid law. Banning dogs.  Kibbles and bits and bits and bits.  You! You son of a bitch! This is all your fault!  - What the? - Ha-ha!  (BOTH GRUNTING)  (CAR HORN HONKS)  You thirsty, boy? Yeah, you're a thirsty boy.  - Wait a minute, we're fighting! - (GRUNTS)  Aah!  And now, time to make my getaway.  Brian, oh, my God! Are you all right?  Here, let me mend you, like in a 1990s action movie.  Aw, thanks. That is better.  Look at us. What are we doing?  (SIGHS) I don't even know anymore.  You know what?  I'm sorry I destroyed your dream, Quagmire.  I know you loved that cafÃ©.  Wow. Um thanks, Brian.  Why did you open that place, anyway?  Well honestly, I just thought  that maybe I could put something good in the world for a change.  What do you mean?  I mean that uh  I've always been about sex and seducing women,  but you know what?  Someday I'm gonna be dead.  And, I-I mean, is that my legacy?  I just thought if I created something  that makes people happy,  maybe people would remember me for that.  You probably think that's stupid.  Quagmire I'm here for you.  For emotional support.  Thanks, Brian. What do you say?  You want to go for a walk?  I always want to go for a walk.  Hey, does anyone know what's going on with my brown crayon?  Because it disappeared from the box for a while,  and now it's back.  It's a little I don't know, oily and misshapen?  I'm not a crayon scientist,  but it looks like it's seen some heat.  The city repealed a law prohibiting animals  from public businesses today.  And finally, tonight  We built this city!   There. Now it's in your head, too.  Well, I'm glad you get to go out in public again, Brian.  I'm glad you, Chris, and Meg are back from that Christian camp.  Hey, where is Meg, anyway?  Oh, she was so mad I dragged her to Christian camp,  she ran away to live with a Japanese family.  (JAPANESE-STYLE MUSIC PLAYING)  Damare, Meg!  - (FARTS) - (SCREAMS)  (OTHERS LAUGHING)  Family Guy over! On-uh Foxuuu!"
S18e6,OTHERS:,"Huh.  Oh, my God, the Wi-Fi is out.  (SCREAMING, SHOUTING)  (GRUNTING)  Okay, everyone calm down.  I know how we'll get through this.  This is the story of the greatest trilogy ever told,  The Mighty Ducks.  It was a time of great nonsense.  Dad, why don't you tell us how you and Mom  fell in love and got married?  And in go the earbuds.  Terrific episode idea, Meg.  Well, it was the 1990s,  the decade of Viagra but also Lorena Bobbitt,  so it was kind of a yay-boo period for penises.  After graduating, your mom and me moved to the city  with all our friends.  (90S-STYLE SITCOM THEME PLAYING)  (FOUR CLAPS)  I lived with my best friends, Quagmire and Cleveland.  We were the kind of friends who were all good-looking,  except for David Schwimmer.  And your mom lived across the hall  with her friends Bonnie and  uh, Bonnie.  God, we desperately need to get  more female characters in this show.  I was the Chandler.  Not because of my sarcastic zingers  but because I liked to take 40 Vicodin a day.  Guys, I've got big news.  Tell 'em, Quagmire.  I got a promotion at Blockbuster!  - (GASPING) - (CLAPPING FOUR TIMES)  Gleonard Quagmire, that is fantastic news!  I know, right? You know how I always felt  like I was stuck in second gear?  Well, this is a new gear!  Well, congratulations, Glenn!  This calls for a fountain dance.  (90S-STYLE SITCOM THEME PLAYING)"
S18e6,PETER:,"I was the least graceful at fountain dancing.  I just swung my arms and tried to fit in.  It was senseless. We were in our clothes,  for God's sake. Everyone got wet.  It was cold. You know,  there were originally nine friends,  but three of 'em died of pneumonia.  I'm still haunted by Chad's shivering last words,  ""Don't let Monica get Botox.""    We also hung out at our favorite cafÃ©, Perk Place,  where we would all sweat like crazy  'cause everyone in the '90s wore turtlenecks,  vests, and Jamiroquai hats.  Lois, you look down. What's wrong?  Brad Pitt broke up with me in a pretty public way.  I just don't know if I'll ever date again.  Wait, I thought you and Dad dated in high school.  Did you break up?  Uh-uh, story's not over, Meg. Settle down.  Your father and I had dated for a few years,  but I didn't know if it was going anywhere.  So we decided to take a break but remained close friends.  I actually briefly dated one of our roommates, Barry.  He was one of them what the fountain took.  My father had planned out my whole life for me.  He wanted me to marry one of Quahog's up-and-comers,  Tom Tucker, Elmer Hartman,  Seamus or Billy Zane.  It's meeting the man of my dreams   And then meeting his beautiful wife   And isn't it ironic   Don't you think?   It's like rain   On your wedding day.   Alanis Morissette was America's sweetheart in the '90s.  She went on to become one of the CDs in the garage."
S18e6,CHRIS:,"Wait, Seamus had arms and legs?"
S18e6,LOIS:,"Chris, I'm not sure you have the green light  to just chime in whenever.  Lois, let's go take a midnight swim at Sharkbite Cove.  Oh, sounds wonderful, Seamus,  but I have other plans.  Okay, well, I'm definitely going.    Peter, why don't you admit it?  You still got the hots for Lois.  It's obvious.  Nah, we're broken up. We're just friends now.  (FOUR CLAPS)  Looking back, I realize he was right.  But the '90s was an exciting time,  and we wanted to experience all it had to offer.  Hey, guys, there's a great concert  in World Trade Center Plaza this weekend!  Really? Who's playing?  They got Korn, Cranberries and Cake.  Oh, that sounds delicious. But who are the bands?  They're opening with Cake.  Wait, shouldn't cake be last? It's a dessert.  Korn is last. Korn is a bigger draw than Cake.  Corn is not a bigger draw than cake.  - Cake is delicious. - ""No Doubt""?  Well, I'm glad you agree with me, Quagmire,  but that still doesn't address this issue of the order.  My last show was a Weezer concert.  Well, that's 'cause everyone smokes nowadays.  What band did we see last time at the Palladium?  It was, uh, Blur.  Yeah, I can't remember, either.  It was a very confusing time in music.  Okay, time for another scene.  Let's transition with a '90s guitar sting  that's way too long.  (90S-STYLE SITCOM THEME PLAYING)  (FOUR CLAPS)    (FOUR CLAPS)  -"
S18e6,CHRIS:,"Dad, what -"
S18e6,PETER:,"H-Hang on, Chris.  It's not done yet.    (MUSIC ENDS)  Okay, there we go."
S18e6,CHRIS:,"What'd you do for a living, Dad?"
S18e6,PETER:,"What any of us did never really mattered.  It was just ""vague business.""  But despite having broken up,  I would sometimes sneak away to the Internet  to go flirt with your mom.  Well, I'm gonna go move my bangs with my pinky  in front of the mirror.  - AOL"
S18e6,GUY:,Welcome! -
S18e6,PETER:,"Shh, shh, shh, shh!  - You've got mail! - Okay, good, but quiet.  You've got male porn!  Shh, shh, shh!  Peter, quit trying to flirt with that clearly girlfriend of yours  and come watch giant box TV with us!"
S18e6,PETER:,"We all watched The X-Files,  which would be Fox's last hit show.  And it was the heyday of the multi-camera sitcom,  and Paul Reiser, its king,  was must-see.  Perhaps I'll try this yogurt.  That's been in there since our wedding.  (GROANS) Perhaps I won't.  (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER)  Peter, admit it.  You're still in love with Lois.  Yeah, every time you see her, you go, ""Schwing!""  Which is, like, the sound  of being lifted by a boner, I think.  Yeah, but we decided we wanted to see other people.  That's only 'cause she got tired of waiting around for you.  Look, she loves you,  but she ain't gonna wait around forever.  I knew they were right.  Your mom was the only one  I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.  So I saved my money, and, a few months later,  I bought a ring.  So, did you enjoy your pesto with pesto?  Does this smile give you your answer?  Lois, there's something I want to ask you.  Will you marry me?  Oh, Peter, I'm-I'm so sorry, but  I'm already engaged to Tom Tucker.  Passed over for Tom Tucker?  That's terrible.  What do you think of that, fellow '90s star Joey Lawrence?  - Meh. - Oh. Huh.  Okay, well, what would you think if I told you  that Blossom would completely drop out of show business  to get a PhD in neuroscience  and then come back and make $15 million a year,  while you would work steadily for 20 years,  lose all your hair and go bankrupt?  - Whoa! - (CHUCKLES): There it is!  Yeah, that's the That's the thing I wanted.  Where's Dad?  AOL"
S18e6,GUY:,"You've got male porn!  Peter, get in here and finish the story!  Sorry, I was just watching some guy take it in the AOL.  - Goodbye. - All right, where were we?  Mom just said she got engaged to Tom Tucker?  Well, deep down, I knew I loved your father,  but I guess I just caved to my father's pressure.  And on my 28th birthday,  he introduced me to my future husband.  (TRIBAL MUSIC PLAYING)  (MUSIC ENDS)  (HIGH-PITCHED):  He's your king-to-be   A king to be forever   A king who'll do whatever   Her Highness   Desires   He's your king-to-be   Thanks, Ollie.  Good afternoon, Lois. I'm Tom Tucker,  your king-to-be.  In other news,  President Clinton sent me a congratulatory cigar,  but it's a little moist."
S18e6,PETER:,"Well, I wasn't gonna give up that easily.  So I decided I was gonna do the most powerful thing  you could do in the '90s: make a mixtape.  Again, Peter, it's your mixtape,  but you've got ""Cotton Eye Joe"" as song number two,  number four, seven and eight.  You think it should be number three as well?  No!  I made it number three as well.  Oh, Peter, I got to say,  the fourth and fifth time I heard ""Cotton Eye Joe,""  it really got to me."
S18e6,LOIS:,"I was so happy.  I knew Peter was the one  I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.  But I dreaded having to tell my father.  Luckily, he was remarkably understanding about it.  I've decided to be remarkably understanding about this.  - Really? - Yes. And to prove it,  I'm going to pay for Peter's bachelor party  at the MTV Beach House.  And I promise it's not part of a ruse  to destroy your affection for Peter once and for all.  Oh, Daddy, thank you!"
S18e6,PETER:,"I was thrilled.  Not only was Carter letting me marry Lois,  but this was gonna be the ultimate bachelor party.  The MTV Beach House was located  in the most hepatitis-rich part of Florida,  known as Florida.  Whassup?!  (CHUCKLES) Commercials.  No skipping those yet.  We partied the same way everyone in the '90s did,  spaced apart by a few feet,  dancing on our own."
S18e6,JOE:,"Yeah, I was pretty much the coolest guy there.  With the best legs.  There were these other idiots there having a bachelor party,  but I didn't know 'em. They were losers.  -"
S18e6,PETER:,Joe? -
S18e6,JOE:,Who's that? Peter?
S18e6,PETER:,"Yeah, get out of my story. What the hell are you doing?"
S18e6,JOE:,"I'm telling the story of my days at the MTV Beach House.  You get out of my story!  I'm about to tell how I met Daria.  So, you partying hard or hardly partying?  Hardly interested.  You're mean!  (DARIA THEME PLAYING)  La-la-la-la-la   La-la-la-la-la."
S18e6,PETER:,"I even got to meet my heroes,  Mark McGrath, Pauly Shore and Jamie Kennedy,  and we became friends.  Guys, come be in my wedding.  Then we can all enter the 2000s together as friends.  Sorry, Peter, but we can't go with you.  We're not allowed in the 2000s.  Yeah, we have to stay back here in the '90s.  - Goodbye, Peter. -"
S18e6,PETER:,"And then,  they all walked into the sea and disappeared forever.  Tell the world about us!"
S18e6,PETER:,"I planned to,  but then I found a half-eaten hot dog  that only had a little bit of sand on it.  And most of the sand was very brushable.  You can pretty much wash a hot dog with soap and water,  and you can still eat it.  I danced for eight hours straight on The Grind,  occasionally going into the pool to pee.  Also, for some reason, I was the only guy  - a bee was following the whole time. - (BUZZING)  Maybe it was 'cause of the Country Time Lemonade powder  I'd been eating, or 'cause me and Quagmire  were huckin' Capri Suns at each other.  But little did I know, while I was dancing  and periodically peeing in the pool,  Carter was orchestrating a plan  to destroy my relationship with your mom once and for all.  Hey, you're Daisy Fuentes.  Oh, that's how I say my last name.  You're the hottest girl of 1990-this.  I've got a proposition for you.  (WHISPERING)  Hey, there. You're all that and a bag of chips.  What a cool phrase.  I hope it never sounds dumb and dated.  (BOTH GRUNT)  (CROWD CHEERING, WHISTLING)  (DAISY GRUNTING)  Look, Peter's wrestling with Daisy Foo-en-taze!  (INDISTINCT CHATTER)  (BOTH GRUNTING)  (DAISY GRUNTS)"
S18e6,PETER:,It all happened so fast.  Oh. We're having fun 'cause it's not 9/11 yet. Mmm.
S18e6,PETER:,"But the next thing I knew,  I was kissing Daisy Fuentes.  And it was on national television."
S18e6,LOIS:,I was home doing what girls did at the time  Looking at pictures of John Elway.  (SIGHS) My horse-toothed dreamboat.  Denver looks beautiful.  (GASPS) Peter?! How could you?!
S18e6,LOIS:,"My heart shattered the moment I saw it.  I took your father's mixtape and hucked it into the ocean.  Right then and there, I vowed I would never see him again.  (LAUGHS)  She said ""wood.""  (LAUGHS)  That was cool.  Yeah. Wood! Wood!  You're right! Wood.  (LAUGHTER)  (LAUGHTER CONTINUES)  (LAUGHTER)  Daddy, tell us more about the black '90s.  Well, Magic Johnson got AIDS, and I was like, ""What?!""  But then, he came back the next season and scored 30 points  in a game where no one would touch him.  And he caught it through heterosexual sex contact?  Well, that is magic.  (LAUGHS) Terrific. Thank you, Cleveland.  And thank you to the entire Brown family,  whose last name escapes me at the moment.  (LAUGHS) Terrific.  Thanks, Dad.  Now back to your story.  I had just lost the love of my life.  So as a way to forget my pain,  I threw myself into a dot-com startup with Quagmire.  We were two ambitious young entrepreneurs  at the height of the dot-com bubble.  Oogle? Goo goo?  Gah-gah goo? Gee-gee goo? Go go go?  Keep saying baby words, Peter. You're onto something.  We're close. We're circling it!  Goo-goo gah-gah? Oo oogle? Ooh eee ooh ah ah?  Moments late, we'd found a business idea destined  to change the tech world forever: Googoogle.  A search engine for all the info on the Goo Goo Dolls.  People are always gonna need information about them!"
S18e6,PETER:,"We were on our way.  We rented office space,  and watching it gave us the idea to rent office space.  (LAUGHS) Lumbergh.  (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)  Uh, clearly, we hadn't discussed the, uh,  tone of our work environment.  I should say we haven't.  I thought this was to be a place of business.  We got over our initial differences,  and then spent the rest of the day doing  what everybody did in the '90s  Debating what was better Forrest Gump or Pulp Fiction.  Forrest Gump is ridiculous!  One guy does what he's told all the time and makes millions.  But a girl goes off, tries to be different, gets AIDS, and dies!  I find your argument shallow and pedantic.  I didn't see either one.  I saw Ace Ventura 50 times.  Laughed so hard, I crapped myself in the theater.  Just thinking about it now makes me  (LAUGHS)  - (LOUD FLATULENCE) - Ow!"
S18e6,LOIS:,"Meanwhile, my wedding plans  with Tom Tucker were back on.  Are you ready? I can't believe  the wedding is just two scenes away.  What's wrong, sweetie?  I guess I'm just not sure if I'm doing the right thing.  What if this is a mistake?  Trust me, you're doing the right thing. It's gonna be great.  Now, listen, we don't have too much time before the wedding,  so I want to go over something  regarding the father-daughter dance.  It goes, ""Dallah-hollah wallah-ballah-dallah Macarena,  wakka-lakka-chakka-hakka-bakka Macarena.""  Daddy, I don't think  ""The Macarena"" is the best father-daughter dance.  Well, how about another song from the '90s?  Casey would waltz with the strawberry blonde   And the band played on   What? Wrong '90s?"
S18e6,PETER:,"Like everything stupid  in the '90s, Googoogle took off.  We celebrated in grand dot-com bubble fashion:  by having an outrageous yacht party  with lobster fights and hookers.  We did Ecstasy, which was terrible for you,  and only ever made me feel fantastic.  Kids, don't do it. It's too awesome.  They said it would burn a hole in your brain,  - but show me the hole. -"
S18e6,LOIS:,"Peter, that's enough."
S18e6,PETER:,"If you hate pure, unconditional love  and experiencing the profound harmony of the universe,  definitely do not try this drug.  There's also, like, a 90% chance you'll hook up,  but really, no, don't do it.  Even if you don't hook up, you don't care.  But you'll hook up, guaranteed."
S18e6,LOIS:,"Okay, Peter, let's move on."
S18e6,CHRIS:,And what was the name of that drug?
S18e6,PETER:,"But despite our success,  something was missing.  Peter, we did it!  What's the matter? You still sad about Brandon Lee?  Yeah. I never heard of him before he died,  but when he died, it was so sad.  But also, it's Lois.  She's getting married tomorrow.  Somehow, all this success feels meaningless,  knowing I'm about to lose her forever.  Peter, then you need to stop that wedding  before it's too late.  But we've got a business to run.  You don't care about this business.  All you've ever cared about is Lois.  This is your last shot.  Peter, you get to that wedding."
S18e6,PETER:,"They were right.  So I decided to get there  the way everyone got around in the '90s  Propelled by an explosion.  (LOUD EXPLOSION)  (ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING)  Do you, Lois Commondenominator Pewterschmidt,  accept this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?  (ALL GASPING)  Peter? What the hell are you doing here?!  Lois, can I talk to you privately?  (LOUD EXPLOSION)  What is it, Peter?  Before you marry Tom, what's the Mortal Kombat blood code?  I keep forgetting.  It's ""A-B-A-C-A-B-B,"" but you can't do this now!  You're ruining my wedding!  Lois, if I didn't come here,  I'd regret it for the rest of my life.  I know I screwed up, and I don't deserve you,  but I can't stop thinking about you, day and night.  It's been this way since the day we met.  I fell in love with you then, and I'll never stop.  Unless Daisy Fuentes felt something?"
S18e6,DAISY:,"Uh, I didn't.  Lois, you're the only woman for me.  He cheated on you!  No daughter of mine is going to marry a cheater!  Daddy's right.  Peter, I'm sorry, but you blew it.  I was in love with you, too, but then you cheated on me.  You kissed Daisy Fuentes.  Lois, there's something you should know.  He didn't kiss me. I kissed him.  Because you felt something?  Because Carter paid me.  Well, that's something!  Daddy is that true?  I only did it to protect you from making a huge mistake!  Lois, I may not be as smart or as handsome  as the guys your dad wants for you,  but I love you more than all of 'em put together.  That's a fact. Just as sure  as the Star Wars movies are a perfect isolated trilogy,  unmarred by additional canon.  Oh, Peter!  (ORGAN PLAYS ""WEDDING MARCH"")  - Damn it, stop them! -"
S18e6,PETER:,"One by one,  members of Lois' family tried to stop me, but I laid 'em out.  There's something about punching someone  - in a church that just feels good. - (YELLING)  (BELL TOLLING)  (LOUD EXPLOSION)  Cleveland picked us up in a white Bronco.  (TIRES SQUEALING)  Why did you have a white Bronco, Daddy?  I was driving my innocent friend O.J.  and his ex-wife's head down to Mexico."
S18e6,PETER:,"We eloped at Fenway Park,  which I paid 50 grand to rent out  the day before the dot-com bubble burst.  I now pronounce this the last straight marriage.  - (BOTH MOANING) -"
S18e6,PETER:,And I think  I got swindled on the Fenway deal  because there was a game that night.  - (BAT CLACKS) - STADIUM
S18e6,ANNOUNCER:,It's a hit!  No! That would have been the game-winning run!  The Red Sox lose.
S18e6,ALL:,Boo!
S18e6,LOIS:,"I was having serious regrets  about my decision, but was already pregnant with Meg,  so there was no backing out."
S18e6,ALL:,"Boo!  (BEE BUZZING)  This bee's chasing me! Somebody call Ace Ventura!  - (LAUGHS) - (LOUD FLATULENCE)  Ow!  (BOTH LAUGHING)  (ALL THREE LAUGHING)  Aw.  Wow, Mom and Dad. I feel like I learned so much tonight.  And not just about you guys, but also about the '90s.  Oh, there's a lot more to learn about the '90, Meg.  Like, for instance, are you familiar  with a band called ""Counting Crows""?  I think I might have heard them in a Starbucks.  Yes, you have.  Anyway, their lead singer is this thing called Adam Duritz.  He looks like if Marc Maron had sex with a scarecrow  and gave birth to a baby made of hemp.  I always thought he looked like the Cowardly Lion  in a suburban white high school production of The Wiz.  - That's not what that is? - No, Chris.  But actually, the joke's on us,  because this Sideshow Bob burnout slept  with a primo roster of '90s tail.  - Jennifer Aniston. - No.  - Courteney Cox. - What?!  - Winona Ryder. - That guy?!  Christina Applegate, Lara Flynn Boyle, Emmy Rossum.  Ooh, this is just making me angry.  - Mary-Louise Parker. - I hear she's difficult."
S18e7,JOE:,"Yes, I'm looking for Abe Froman,  the sausage king of Chicago.  Heavyset fellow, glasses.  Oh, w-well, he's right here.  Let me just Wait a minute!  We don't have phones or Chicago!  All right, you got to die.  Enough! You three, out of my house!  I will not play host to some family feud!  (FAMILY FEUD THEME PLAYING)  100 people surveyed.  Top five answers are on the board.  Name something you might say to a damned spot.  (BUZZER SOUNDING)  Out.  - Good answer! Good answer! - Ah, good answer, good answer.  - Yeah, yeah, good answer. - Show me ""out""!  (BELL CLANGS)  What?! That's impossible!  Romeo, name something you might say to a damned spot.  Hello.  (BELL CLANGS)  - What?! - I know this audience.  - Of course it was ""hello."" - Of course it was.  (HARPSICHORD PLAYING ""IN YOUR EYES"")  Romeo?  - Juliet. - (DISCORDANT NOTES PLAY)  I know I ain't supposed to be here,  but I just had to see you again.  Oh, Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo?  I What-what what are you talking about?  I'm right here. You're looking right at me.  You know what? I'll come up there.  - Romeo, we can't. - (GRUNTING)  What if my father sees us?  And ""wherefore"" means ""why,"" by the way, not ""where.""  Shh, shh, shh, shh.  That's stupid. You're stupid.  Juliet, I know we just met,  but when I look at you, I feel something special.  This is gonna sound crazy, but will you marry me?  Okay, let's do it.  I love you, Romeo.  I love you, too, Juliet.  (BOTH MOANING)  I should probably let you know  I have a lot of Jack Skellington tattoos.  Well, I wish you would have told me that before,  but that's okay, because I do karate outside against no one.  Yeah, this is gonna be a good marriage.  There he is!  There's the dumb-ass I've been looking for.  - (GRUNTS) - (SHOUTS)  Mercutio!  (GRUNTS) I could never say this  when I was alive, but  ""Ralph Fiennes.""  (GROANS)  (GROWLING)  (GRUNTING)  (COUGHING)  (GRUNTING) Oh, God.  I'm voiding my bowels right now because I died,  not 30 minutes ago in the carriage on the way here.  (GRUNTING)  (GASPS)  Welp, we all know how this goes.  (SIREN WHOOPS)  I'm doin' it!  Oh, Friar Laurence,  are you absolutely sure faking my death  with this poison is the best plan?  Well, there's also Herbalife, which is an amazing product.  And I think you, specifically,  would make a great addition to our team.  I-I'll take the poison. Thank you, Friar.  A-And since I'm picking up a prescription,  can I, uh, pay for the rest of my items here?  Uh, I-I guess.  (ANNOYED SIGH)  Oh, (SIGHS) yourself.  I'm afraid she's dead.  You can tell by her shallow breathing  and weak but clear heartbeat.  I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.  Can you make a paper airplane?  - I can. - Then don't be so hard on yourself.  Oh, no! My girlfriend's dead!  And on top of that, it's that time in late summer  before football starts and there's no basketball.  I mean, there is baseball, but it's not playoffs.  I might as well just be dead!  (COUGHS, CHOKING)  (WEAKLY): Children having sex,  two murders,  double suicide.  Very irresponsible to teach this  in schools.  (GRUNTS)  Romeo? Romeo?  Oh, wherefore?  - Stupid. - I don't understand.  We had a plan!  Did you think I was dead just because I faked my own death?!  Maybe there's still poison on your lips.  Mm. Alas.

Look, it's not my fault.  My plan was to just hide this from you forever.  Also, she's pregnant.  How is that possible?  Well, when a man and a woman like each other just a little  and they get in an elevator  Oh, God!  How could I be so blind?!  I wouldn't be so hard on yourself, honey.

Simon.  Knock, knock.  Stewie, can you see who's there?  - What? - Someone was knocking at the door.  It-it was me. I just went ""knock, knock.""  There they are again.  I don't even know how to process that,  so I'm just gonna crack on.  I have somebody here that would like to see you.  - Your teddy bear. - You don't have to be coy.  I know he was yours first.  And, well, I want you to have Skippy back.  I know you're going to try and stop me, but hear me  - Okay. - Oh. Great.  Then I'll just leave him here.  I hope you're both very happy together, Chris.  He belongs with you, not me.  Well, I should get back to my book.  That's a clock, but okay.  This is just one night, got it?  Now, I'm going to call you Rupert.  You okay with that?  And tomorrow, nothing happened.  By the way, I have a Sleep Number bed.  But don't worry, I don't use it for sexual purposes.  (motor whirring)  What do you think of that?  That something you can work with?  (yawning)  Well, looks like someone was up late.  Yeah, I tend to sleep a little longer  when I'm resting under a big, furry bear.  Oh, no! They's doin' gay jokes without me.  Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay.  You're part of it now.  God, you're sexy.  What are you looking at?! I told you that was one night!  Now get out. I called you an Uber.  I'll know if you went further than your house.  - Hey, what are you doin'? - Oh, hey, Bri.  I was just putting some product in my hair, you know.  Yeah, this looks good. Give it a little height.  Let everyone know Stewie's back on the market.  I heard that on Friends.  Did you know they're all 60 now?  I knew Courteney Cox was.  So, how you doing with Rupert gone and everything?  Are you kidding? I'm fantastic!  He was kind of holding me back, if I'm being honest.  It's time I got out there again. I've had one bear my whole life.  - That's not normal. - Nothing about you is normal.  I mean, I've already wasted a whole year of my life with him.  There's only been a year of your life.  You know, all of your responses have been very similar,  so you might want to nip that in the bud.  Look, the truth is, things got a bit stale between us.  There wasn't one part of Rupert's body  that I didn't know by heart.  None of it excites me anymore.  Well, do you want me to keep an eye on Rupert for you?  Make sure he's doing okay?  No need. I turned him into a nanny cam.  - A nanny cam? - Yeah, I put it inside him.  Deep. It's inside him now.  I-I don't know how to respond that won't sound similar  to other responses I've made, so just, uh, continue.  Right. Well, whenever Chris and Rupert interact,  ten minutes later, I'll get a chime notification on my phone,  and I can pull up the video.  Why is there a delay?  Why can't you get the video immediately?  I don't know. Why can't you poop on a toilet?  - Fair. - (phone chimes)  Ah, it's chiming, it's chiming.  Okay, okay, calm down, just calm down.  (breathes deeply)  Now, what do we have?  Oops. Sorry, Skippy.  (gasps) Are you seeing what I'm seeing?  Is Chris wearing a nicotine patch?  You know what, it's just like I said.  He and Chris go together, like peaches and cream.  Peaches. Peaches, I'm sorry.  Damn it. You could've at least given me some warning.  At least a-a shoulder tap.  I know, you're right.  It's just that you're so beautiful,  I can't control myself sometimes.  Aw, I can't stay mad at you.  How about a kiss?  (chuckles): No-ho-ho-ho. Oh, no.  (forced laughter)  I'm sorry, was that loud? Sorry, everyone.  We're being loud. Oh, this is Anton.  Stewie, let Mommy help you into your high chair.  Well, I am a little wobbly today.  It's your fault, you know.  Stop it, we're with my family.  Easy. You're pinching my pits.  God, it's like being picked up with lobster claws.  We hate her, by the way.  Ah, I see you got my text to bring Rupert to dinner.  You're looking well. And this is Anton.  He's in the touring company of Dear Evan Hansen.  My, aren't we all very modern?  He's just here 'cause I got gum on him and he stuck to my hand.  Okay, that's sickening.  Remember when that bear used to be yours, Chris?  Oh, you used to take him with you every  You shut your mouth, you hear me? Shut it!  Oh, someone's tired.  Brian, you want to put the baby down?  Okay, yeah, he is a little fussy.  I'll take him upstairs. Come on, Stewie.  Brian, he's not in Evan Hansen.  He's a male prostitute.  Very cheap.  Please tell me Rupert looked fat, Brian. I'm begging you.  He's a stuffed bear He-he looked enormous.  Yeah, I thought so, too. Puffy, you know?  Glug, glug, glug. Someone's back on the sauce.  (phone chimes)  Goodnight, Skippy.  Just a warning, I had some bad experiences at camp,  so now I sleep with one eye open.  (raspy breathing)  I can't believe it, Brian. I've been forgotten.  I can't take it anymore! It's eating me alive!  What are you gonna to do?  I-I need to take a trip.  You know? Go on a spiritual journey.  Find out who Stewie is without Rupert, you know?  I just have to get an Uber to the airport.  Wait my Uber rating is 4.2?! What happened?  (classical music playing)  (tires screech)    (Indonesian music playing)  Excuse me, I'm in Bali on a spiritual journey  but I seem to have mistakenly wandered  on to the heavy people beach.  Do you happen to know where the thin, attractive beach is?  Thank you and good luck with whatever's going on with you.  Hey. You should've seen the pigs where I was before.  I'm only wearing a Speedo because that's what they wear  in this country.  (chuckles): If I if I weren't wearing one,  then I would stand out, right?  I'm on a spiritual journey. You?  Oh, you don't speak English. Cool.  Rupert? Rupert, is that you?! You followed me!  This can be a second chance for us.  Let's put everything behind Oh oh.  Sorry, I'm-I'm so embarrassed.  You-you look like an old friend.  He lives with someone else now.  Well, sorry.  You've got to get a grip on yourself, Stewie.  Put Rupert and Chris out of your head.  Excuse me, where are your parents?  Oh. I-I don't I'm-I'm-I'm like  I'm like a I'm-I'm like a baby guy.    (Italian music playing)  Mm. So anyway,  so I'm-I'm Eat Gay Loving it and it's-it's going great.  And I Yeah, I finally feel  like I'm getting my life together again  af-after the breakup.  Oh, my God, oh, this pasta This is amazing.  This is amazing.

You know, love me.  Stop-stop pouring. Stop pouring. I can't  I can't keep track of how much I'm drinking. Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you so much for taking me out, guys.        The retreat is now finished.  I hope you have found the peace you have come here looking for.  Wow. I have so much clarity now.  I know how I'm going to move on.  I have to kill Chris and Rupert right away.  I guess that means I'll miss that taping  of Deepak Choprah Winfrey.  Everyone, check your seats!  You get diarrhea!  - (cheering) - And you get diarrhea!  And you get diarrhea!  Everyone's getting diarrhea!  So, how was the trip?  Um, fabulous.  Well, I have to say, you do look better.  I feel better, Bri.  It was the best thing I could have done for myself.  And you're good with Chris and Rupert now?  Oh, yeah, I'm so good.  Yeah, I acted like a real tool before.  You know, I'm actually gonna make it up to them.  Well, I'm so glad to hear that, Stewie.  What are you gonna do?  I've got something super special planned.  Well, I'm happy you're back. I missed you.  I'm happy I'm back, too. Oh, and you can skip India.  Huh. Really?  How old is this place?  That black-and-white TV still has a white dot  from when they turned it off six years ago.  Hey, Chris, just checking to see  how long before you and Rupert get here.  Okay, see you soon, pal.  Hope you're hungry. I'm making something really special.  Goodness, I haven't done a maniacal laugh in a while.  Hope I'm not rusty.  (forced laughter)  That's perfect.  Takeout's fine, he'll never know.  I don't know why I said I was making dinner.  I'm committing a murder, I should've realized  I wouldn't also want to cook.  They're here! I can't wait for Rupert to see how good I look.  It'll be the last thing he sees.  - Hi, guys! - Hey, Stewie,  I brought Rupert, just like you said.  Yes, and nothing else, I see.  What do you mean?  Like dessert or a bottle of wine.  It's customary to bring a hostess gift  - when invited to dinner. - I didn't know.  Everyone knows that but whatever. Sit, sit, sit!  Well, how is everything?  Oh, Anton couldn't make it.  Poor thing's brother has AIDS.  Anyhoo, it is so good to see the two of you.  This is weird. Why am I here?  For dinner. Here.  What are we having?  Uh pasta primavera.  Who made this?  I made it. I told you I was making dinner.  It tastes like it's from a store.  Well, it's not! You know, you're making this thing  a whole lot easier.  What whole thing?  I thought I could live with the idea  of you and Rupert together, I-I really did.  I see the way he looks at you.  He used to look at me like that.  Knowing he loves you and not me,  it's too painful and I now realize  Sorry, that's been bugging me all day.  I now realize the only way I can go on with my life  is by ending yours.  You're planning on killing me?  Oh, my God, you poisoned my food?  That's why it tastes so funny!  It's from a good store!  I thought you said you made it.  I did m All right, look, we're-we're getting off track here.  How much longer do I have?  There's no poison in the food, Chris.  Although, that actually would have been smart, wouldn't it?  Damn it. I'm sorry,  I-I haven't done this whole Hitchcock thing before.  This hasn't been very Hitchcockian.  Oh, that you know.  Then I'm just gonna leave.  A-And why should I bring a gift  - if you were gonna kill me? - Etiquette?  Look, I'm afraid I can't let you go, Chris.  (grunts)  - (gasps) - Peter, what is it?  I forgot to record Young Sheldon.  Oh, we got a nice evening for this. Nice evening.  It's like the perfect temperature.  I don't even need a sweater.  Wait. What are you doing, Stewie?  You can turn around right now and go back home.  This is your brother.  (both grunt)    This is exactly how it happened in the movie!  How can you say this isn't like Hitchcock?!  This is from The Talented Mr. Ripley.  It's not a Hitchcock film!  - It's not? - No.  It was directed by Anthony Minghella.  (choking): But isn't it a remake?  Of a French film! (cries out)  Oh! (grunts)  This is all because of you, Rupert.  You broke my heart.  - And now it's your turn. - (phone chimes)  Okay, Rupert, so remember,  we sit through a nice dinner  and then you go back with Stewie.  Because I love my little brother, and so do you.  You guys belong together.  So you do love me.  Oh, Rupert, I love you so much!  And I didn't want to say it because I-I didn't know if you  were going to say it back and oh, what a fool I've Chris!    (panting, grunting)  (grunting)  (grunting continues)    Come on, he's my brother.  Well, you have to use a little tongue.  (coughing)  (gasping)  Chris, are you all right? Please, say something!  I don't think Jordan Peele has the talent  we've attributed to him.  Because of the lake water,  uh, I said some things that I did not mean.  Jordan Peele is our greatest living filmmaker, and visionary,  both in comedy and in drama.  There is nothing he can't do.  (distorted): Good. Now let's make some twin porn.  Hit me again and you got a deal.  Hey, sleepyhead.  - Stewie. - How ya feelin', pal?  Uh Okay.  Do you remember what happened?  - No. - That's the right answer.  Well, you have a lovely day  and we'll see you when you get home.  I think we can get a heart from this kid.  Uhp, nope, he's up."

It's this all day.  Oh, that's right.  I'm not allowed to mention I'm paying for this.  It's both 100% true  and also the worst thing anybody could possibly say.  He had his arms crossed the whole ride here.  Excuse me if I don't buy into  this whole headshrinker business.  Stewie promised he'd make healthy meals for us,  but all he ever makes is frozen pizza.  You said you loved pizza, especially when I make  the ones with the crust made of ""hwheat.""  He also does that.  Oh, really? Go ahead.  Show him those girls you follow on Instagram.  It's all bosoms and derrieres on there.  This is all stuff I've talked about with my life coach, Kyle.  (CHUCKLES): Yeah, ""life coach.""  Kyle's into you and you know it.  What?!  Okay. Chris, why don't you tell your side of the story  while I share looks with Stewart that say,  ""whoa, this is what you got to deal with?""  (CRYING): This is just so hard.  Stewie won't stop blaming me about the death,  but it's not my fault.  I didn't kill our squirrel.  You know, I'm sad, too!  - (CRYING) - I know. I-I just  I just don't know what to do with all these feelings!  Which is why I suppose I've been taking them out on you.  I'm so sorry, Chris.  (SNIFFLES) Me, too, Stewie.  We can't bring our baby back,  but we'll always have Tuesday through Friday of last week.  Keep talking.  I's just gonna open up this big book  and use the time you're paying for  to figure out when you're next available.  It was a true pleasure parenting our squirrel with you, Chris.  Likewise, Stewie.  And although his life was brief,  I'll always have very fond memories of him.  Wait, ""him""?  It-it was a her.  No, it wasn't. The squirrel was a boy.  What? That's crazy.  - Chris, he was a boy. - How do you know?  Well, you've got to check with your finger.  But you really got to get it in there.  Huh. Well, then maybe it's better  that our baby you molested is dead.  Ooh, fudge!  ""Don't be a grinch.  Please return plate to G. Quagmire.""  Oh, great. So it's a gift and an errand.  Oh.  Oh, dear.  (CRYING)  I love L.A.   We love it!"
S19e3,PETER:,All right! New pants!
S19e5,PETER:,"Oh, boy, this is it.  He wants me to have sex with Bonnie.  Now, remember, Peter, you can't say yes right away.  You let him talk you into it.  He's watching for that. It's part of the dance.  I will absolutely have sex with Bonnie."
S19e5,JOE:,"Sorry, Peter, you're too eager.  So, I came over to invite you  to Susie's christening this weekend.  - Oh. - And I don't just  want you to be a guest.  I was wondering if you'd be willing to be the godfather.  - Godfather? - Yeah, you're my best friend,  and, well, I'd like you to be Susie's godfather, too.  - Godfather II? - Wow, you're really warming to this.  Well, you've made two very compelling arguments.  Perhaps we should discuss this further in my poorly-lit den.  So, about this offer  What are you guys discussing? And when did we get a den?  Sorry, Lois, half of being a godfather  is closing the door in your wife's face  while she wonders what's going on inside.  But I just wanted to"
S19e5,PETER:,"I forgot it was a swinging door.  (BELL TOLLING)  (ITALIAN ACCENT): DiGiorno. DiGiorno.  Joe Paterno.  DiGiorno.  Damn it, Peter, being Susie's godfather  doesn't mean you're in the mob.  And you can't bring a cat to church.  Why not? He's Cat'lic.  (CAT SNICKERING)  (GIGGLES) He does a Muttley laugh.  Where's the priest?  Oh, the church ran out of priests months ago,  'cause of all the diddlin'.  Now they just have a rabbi fill in.  Shalom, everyone.  Welcome to the christening.  Now, before the child goes in the water,  has it been at least 20 minutes since she ate?  - Yes, Rabbi. - Wonderful.  Then let's dunk this kid like a doughnut.  I hereby christen this child in the name of Jesus Christ,  who was killed by we-don't-know-who,  it's not important.  The last thing we want to do is point fingers  Can you please take my daughter out of the water?  Sorry.  Congratulations, sweetie, you're a Christian.  From now on, every Sunday you get to eat a hard cookie  and pretend it's a guy.    Coffee in the smallest cup we have, as you requested.  - Grazie. - And let me assure you,  any shouting you hear from the kitchen  is not Gordon Ramsay tearing us apart.  GORDON"
S19e5,RAMSAY:,"Oh, disgusting!  - (DISH SHATTERS) - Scusi.  Oh, God, here comes Doug. He just got a race car bed,  and now I'm gonna have to hear about it.  Hey, Stewie. Still sleeping in the slow lane?  (FORCED CHUCKLING) Okay. Okay.  So, your mom still taking you to the ladies' room  - to go pee-pee? - Actually, yes.  Yeah, me, too. I don't like the men's room.  All the urinals are at mouth level.  I don't look at those. I'm too busy fixing my hair  in the mirror Oh! I'm sorry.  Ciao, Stewie!  God, that was humiliating.  This party has turned south quick.  Like Bryan Singer's remake of Casablanca.  Here's looking at you, actual kid.  Everyone, I'd like to say a few words.  Uh, it's a very special day,  as we dedicate Susie's life to Christ  before she can consent to it  or have any conception of what's happening.  Susie once licked a booger off my hand.  - I'm Chris, by the way. - Thanks, Chris,  but let's wait till we're called upon, bud.  Anyway, thank you all for coming.  And to the host.  Joe, thank you for having us in this restaurant  with a painted wall that makes Venice look terrible."
S19e5,OTHERS:,"To Joe!  Everyone, enjoy.  Uh, for the kids, we've got games  and also a party princess dressed as Elsa  who's clearly a prostitute,  but please don't proposition her here,  just nod in her direction, trust me, she'll get it.  It's her profession.  Oh, cool, they got a piÃ±ata!  - Peter, it's for the kids. - Like hell it is.  I'm the godfather of this event,  and I want a debilitating wine-and-candy headache.  Give me that, kid.  I'm your son, you dick.  Sir, please, you're making a scene.  No, I'm not. I can do whatever I want.  I'm the godfather.  Uh-oh.  I'm-a so sorry, sir. I didn't know.  Stanley Tucci.  Bobby Cannavale.  Hey! Portuguese waiters pretending to be Italians!  Get the godfather whatever he wants!  - Godfather? - There's a new godfather?  Aw, look at the wall.  Why does Venice always look-a so terrible?  From now on, you eat on the house.  You will be treated with the utmost respect, Godfather.  Grazie. Now please name the menu item I ordered after me.  The dinosaur chicken tenders?  All right, we'll find something else. Thank you very much.  Hear that, Doug? My dad's now the godfather.  And yours is  VP of Systems Integration or something?  What was that, Stewie?  I was invited to sit at the first grade table.  What?! How'd you get that invite?  Big D energy, Stewie.  You either got it or you don't.  Oh, yeah? What does the ""D"" stand for?  - Divorced? - (OTHERS GASP)  - Wh-What?! - Stewie,  my parents are trying to make it work.  - Gee, Stewie. - They're doing their best.  He ended things with the nanny.  Not that it's any of your business.  Oh, yeah. Uh, g-g-g-good for them.  Gene and Sheryl are wonderful people.  I-I hope they make it work. Good vibes. Healing.  G-G-G-God bless you all.  God, I can't believe Mike Pence came out of the closet  just before he hung himself in prison.  - Bon Jovi, family. - Morning, Dad.  Are things gonna change now that you're a godfather?  Good question, Chris. And yes, quite a bit.  I'll be touching faces a lot more than I used to.  My boys. My bambinos.  No touch.  And I'll be totally oblivious to the affair  between my bodyguard and my wife.  You look very nice today, Vincenzo.  Hey! She gave you a compliment.  What, do you got cotton in your ears? Answer her.  Yeah, meathead. What's with this guy, Pop?  And as a mafioso, I'll be doing more voice-overs,  which will always begin by naming everyone at the event.  - What does that even mean? -"
S19e5,PETER:,"There we were - at breakfast.  It was me, Chris G.,  Meggs, Lois Griff,  Little Stew  and Uncle Junior Grandpa Nephew  who was my cousin.  It was one of those breakfasts where you realize  you put on your boxers the wrong way  and you need an excuse to leave the room.  - We're out of syrup. - I'll get it. You stay here.  And will you be a stricter dad now?  Interesting question. My value system  will vary wildly between incredible immorality  and intense social conservatism.  Dad, there's a shipment of heroin in our driveway.  - Excellent. - I watched a PG-13 movie last night.  In your mother's house?  Now, everyone keep eating until you throw up.  What's this? As a leader in the Italian community,  I'll be getting very upset about store-bought pasta sauce.  Peter, what the hell?  That was our Prego.  Yeah, and prego means ""you're welcome.""  It's a very cocky name for an average pasta sauce.  The rest of this is just jokes, but that's kind of a good point.  Now, kids, before you go to school,  let's discuss what you tell your friends about me.  That your fingernails are so filthy  because you do scratchers all day?  Never talk about the family business!  Things are too hot here for you now.  You need to go to Italy for five years.  - What?! - You're not safe here anymore,  so I'm gonna send you where all the murderers are from.    (GASPS)  A questo brajola que facia te di.  Rudy Giuliani.  Antipasti di Miguel Corleone a Sicilia di movies!  Mario Batali el gropo Buca di Beppo Ford Coppola.    Ooh!

Dingaling's is great.  Now, just watch where you hang your hat.  'Cause of boners.  Now, you three are gonna be my lieutenants.  And don't worry, you're all equal in my eyes.  I don't care one bit if you laugh at my jokes.  I mean, this is the Mafia, not the Laugh Factory, right?  - Ha! That's hilarious. - Quagmire is now my top lieutenant.  What?! You said we don't have to like your jokes.  Well, I didn't realize it was such a chore.  This is bullcrap.  And, Joe, you're a cop, how are you okay with any of this?  Are you asking an Irish cop why he's corrupt?  Question withdrawn.  So, uh, what do we do now, Peter?  Well, now that we're a Mafia crew,  I have to do voice-over naming everyone at the event.  - What does that even m -"
S19e5,PETER:,"There we were at the club.  It was me, Glenn Quags, Joey Swan  and Downtown Julie Cleveland Brown.  You remember when there were two Julie Browns in the '90s?  What a mess.    With the guys at my side,  we were the most powerful criminal organization in Quahog  We lived like kings,  until things started to come apart  after the Lufthansa heist.  We discussed laying low, but not everyone agreed with that.  Be careful with this. We stole it.  Hey, Brian, just a heads-up.  Now that I'm an Italian mob boss,  I may be treating dogs more roughly.  Uh, okay.  Now, where's my chicken parm from last night?  Oh, I, uh, I ate it.  - You ate it? - Yeah, there was no name on it.  It was just sitting there.  Is there a problem?  No. No.  No problem.  (ENGINE STARTS)  (GRUNTING)"
S19e5,LOIS:,"Peter, I'm home from the market!  I got steak sandwiches on ciabatta.  Oh, that's way better than chicken parm.  I'm gonna have it with my last can of cream soda.  Uh, actually, I finished that, too.  That's okay, Brian.  Let's take a ride and get some at the grocery store.  Pull over here. I got to take a leak.  - (GUNSHOTS) - (HORN HONKING)  Leave the gun.  Take the cream soda.  What's going on in here?  Even since Dad became a mobster,  he's been giving me a ton of Italian children's books.  Green Eggs and Pancetta;  Horton Hears a Yo;  Good Night, Mooks;  and Where the Wild Things Is.  - Stewie, this is ridiculous. - It's not all bad.  I like having those Stella D'oro breakfast cookies.  Oh, I ate those, sorry.  Ah, no problem, Brian, no problem at all.  Hey, what do you say you and I do a little fishing?  (GUNSHOT)  Peter, I just got a call from the school.  - When is Chris coming back? - Not for a while.  He moved in with his girlfriend.  But, apparently, they hit a rough patch.  (DOOR OPENS)  (BOTH LAUGH)  Good news, guys. I'm fixing the Olympics.  I paid a diver to take a dive.  (PHONE RINGS)  What do you mean he won?  You know, Peter, you've been a mobster for a while now.  I'm surprised we haven't had any run-ins with rival families.  What are you talking about? They love me.  Like, look at this, this morning, totally unprompted,  they sent me a lovely wrapped fish.  What?  Peter, do you know what this means?  Yeah, that they're nice guys.  Yesterday, one of them even drove by my house to say  I had a beautiful family and it would be a shame  if anything happened to them.  And that's a compliment and empathy.  When's the last time you guys said something like that?  - Uh, Peter, I'm not sure you - And look at this.  They found Meg's ear and returned it.  They returned it! You know how many guys  would keep something like that?  Peter, please close the box.  I think you need to get wise to what's going on here,  because their next message may not be so subtle.    (SCREAMING)  There it is. I've been looking for that.  Oh, thank God, the Mafia doesn't hate me.  ""You's dead, fat ass.  Love, the Mafia.""  (GASPS) Oh, my God.  The Mafia does hate me. (GRUNTS)  MOBSTER 1: Lenny, what are you doing?  I already threw the rock!  MOBSTER 2: I wanted to throw the rock.  We talked about this, you wrote the note,  - I throw the rock. - So let me get this straight,  I do the homework and you get to throw the rock?  - I played baseball in college! - Junior college.  MOBSTER 2: The coach from University of Vermont invited me to walk on!  MOBSTER 1: I didn't even know you liked chucking rocks.  MOBSTER 2: Who doesn't like chucking rocks?  I didn't get into the mob to write letters.  I did it to chuck rocks and eat sandwiches out of foil.  MOBSTER 1: Hey, that actually sounds pretty good.  - You want to go get a sandwich? - MOBSTER 2: Sure,  - from Big Sal's or Fat Sal's? - MOBSTER 1: What's the difference?  MOBSTER 2: One's big, one's fat. What's wrong with you today?  God, I can't believe Melania was deported to Slovenia  and then hung herself in a European prison.  Man, Peter, what are you gonna do about the mob?  Don't worry, I got a plan.  I'm gonna hide and change my identity  to a name no one else has ever heard of.  Roberta Brown.  Peter, that's my daughter's name.  No, it's just some girl I follow on Instagram.  You know, Peter, there may be a way out of this.  Cops have been trying to bring down  the Rhode Island mob for years.  If you can schedule a meeting to discuss your differences  and wear a wire, we'll arrest them after.  Testify against the mob?  How dumb do you think I am?  (HACKING)  - (GASPING) - Oh, my son!  I thought that hard-boiled egg seemed a little shouty.  All right, I'll do it.  But, man, if I'm in danger, so is Chris.  I better warn him to be on the lookout.  (CHEERING)  La dolce vita de duay que questa di Beverly Hills BMW.  Ay!  Que cosa mi amor.  Italiana, tu patri telefona Boyardee.  Grazie.

Oh, it's cold! Oh, it's too cold.  - This is why I told you in advance. - It's too cold.  - I don't want to do this anymore. - Your body heat will warm it.  - I regret this decision deeply. - Just let your body heat  - do the work. - Oh, it's fine now.  See? That's the body heat.  Now, if you get into trouble, department regulations say  we can't go in there unless you say a code phrase.  Something that you'd never actually say in conversation  so we know it's a signal.  The phrase is,  ""Did you see the new Paul Rudd movie?  It's laugh-out-loud funny.""  Come on, can't I just say ""watchable""?  No, no, you have to say it exactly.  ""Heartwarming""? I-I mean, I could just say ""heartwarming.""  Peter, the phrase is the phrase.  Now, you ready to meet those godfathers?  I guess.  Wonder where the word ""godfather"" came from, anyway.  I don't know. I assume it started with God's father.  (PHONE RINGS)  - Yello? - Hey, Dad, I wrote a big show,  and your grandson Jesus is in it.  He's kind of the star of it, really. Can you make it?  (LAUGHS): Well, look at you. I'm there, pal.  When is it? When's the big show?  - It's Good Friday. - Oh, don't say Friday.  Ah, I was afraid of that.  Well, there's kind of a postscript to the story.  - Maybe you could catch that? - Oh, you betcha, slugger.  - It's on Sunday. - Oh, you're kidding!  Doesn't anyone do anything on Tuesdays anymore?  Listen, I'm getting pulled into this meeting right now,  but good luck with your thing.  I promise I'm going to be so nice to my son."
S19e5,JOE:,"Okay, Peter, this is it.  Hey, who are you?  Just act natural. And even though you're miked,  try not to use your radio voice.  (RICK DEES' VOICE): Hey, Providence.  This is Peter Whirlybird Griffin  comin' at you on a sizzlin' Sunday afternoon.  - Peter, no! - Wait a minute.  You're the new don from Quahog.  Follow me.  We're glad that you finally decided to play ball with us.  Let me introduce you to the other dons.  Don Duck.

I can use the mic taped to my chest.  Peter, no!  Uh, the new Paul Rudd movie is watchable.  I repeat, it's very watchable.  Damn it, Peter! You have to say it exactly.  Fine. It's laugh-out-loud funny.  Freeze! You're all under arrest.  Good job, Peter.    Freeze!  All right, nobody do anything stupid.  H-Hold on, I'm just allowing Linkedln  to send automated e-mails to all my contacts.  I said don't do anything stupid.  - (PHONE CHIMES) - ""Peter Griffin wants to add you  to his professional network.""  Oh!

Thank you.  Prego.  Well, turns out being a mobster isn't for me.  Well, I'm just happy you're home safe.  Me, too, Dad.  Has anyone seen the rest of my white wine?  Sorry, Lois. I drank that.  Oh. That's fine, Brian.  Hey, what do you say you and me go for a walk in the woods?  You know what? This is kind of nice.  I thought you were gonna do some kind of Godfather murder on me.  Oh, Brian, I don't watch Mafia movies.  - But I did see Fargo. - Huh?"

That's Chinatown.""  Joe, did you finally get Netflix?  I did. And I just watched Chinatown.  It's kind of gross.  Quahog deserves a cool mayor, like Mayor West was.  But there's no one cooler than Adam West.  If only he had had a offspring.  Speaking of offspring, Faye Dunaway slept with her dad  in Chinatown and then had his baby.  Guys, that movie really messed me up.  Wait a second, Mayor West didn't have any kids,  but he did have a cousin, Wild West.  You guys don't know Wild West?  No. And please don't diminish us  for not knowing the same things you know.  You know how to land an airplane?  No, you don't.

Can you show me? - No. But it's true.  Uh, that seems like the kind of thing  you have to prove right when you say it.  Well, I suppose you're right.  I appreciate you coming all this way, Peter,  but I can't be your mayor.  - But, Wild West, we need you. - (WHISTLES)  I'm sorry.  You get home safe, now.

Please? - Of course you can.  (BABBLES EXCITEDLY)  - (CHIRPING) - (LAUGHS)  Peter said something about me really sticks in your craw.  (CHUCKLES) Let's not make this sexy, okay?  I just don't think it's fair for you to breeze into town  with your rugged good looks and voice of the gods  and assume you should be mayor.  Especially when you're taking an opportunity away  from a very deserving woman.  That's a fair point, Lois.  Do you mind if I make you a sweater while I respond?  (EXHALES) Uh, no.  No, that would be fine.  Lois, I moved my whole family to Oregon when I was 13,  and it taught me that a town is like a horse.  You don't choose it.  - (BLEATS) - It chooses you.  And I believe Quahog has chosen me,  just like it chose my cousin Adam.  Now, the last thing I want to do is take something from a woman.  There's nothing I respect more than women.  (GIGGLES) Is that so?  Yes'm. I've raised 16 daughters  into strong, independent women,  I'm a registered doula,  and I always order edamame for the table.  (SIGHING): Oh, my God. Oh. Huh.  So, y-you're all alone up here?  With no one to  touch your sweaty biceps?  Huh?  A man's never alone, Lois,  so long as he has his principles.  (SHUDDERING): H-H-Holy thundering Lord.  Lois, can we keep it? I'll take care of it, I promise.  - (CHOMPS) - Aah!  Ow! He bit me!  I don't like it now.  (SQUEALING)  Peter, do you wanna maybe do some role-playing?  Okay. I'll be Quentin Tarantino,  and you be the foot I make a mess on.  No, actually, I-I was thinking  that maybe you could pretend to be a cowboy.  Okay.  (SIGHS): Oh, Lois"

Thank you.  Peter, just let me speak to the voters  about the issues they're concerned about.  Or, instead of doing that stupid thing,  we could sabotage Wild West's campaign.  Come on, you can drive.  Big Garfield fan, huh?  Me, too.  - Not this big. - You know, a lot of people  think I'm obsessed, but I think I'm pretty nermal.  (LAUGHING)  Okay, you reeled me back in.  (QUIETLY): Let's see how popular you are when I cut off your mustache.  (GRUNTS)  How is this so strong?  My hair follicles run deeper than the roots of a sequoia.  Git him, fella.  Oh! Aah! (GRUNTS)  Aah!  Nice work.  MUSTACHE (DEEP VOICE): Thanks, boss.  (BUSHES RUSTLING)  (SIZZLING)  - Uh-oh. - Hello?  Could somebody help me?  Don't panic, The Librarian.  (SCREAMS)  WILD"

You're Far-Sided.  Oh, no. What-what do I do about it?  Oh, well, I'm no doctor, but I would say  you either need to get glasses or maybe LASIK.  Is that the surgery people get and then tell everybody they got it?  Yes, it's the veganism of elective surgery.  If you're unsure of what to do,  here's a video of Radiohead front man  and super weirdo Thom Yorke to help you decide.  Hello, I'm Thom Yorke.  You might know me from Radiohead  or my passing resemblance to a melting Tilda Swinton.  Not many people know that I'm blind in one eye.  Can you guess which one?  - This is awful. - Wait, just give it a few minutes.  - All his stuff starts kind of slow. - Fine, I'll get the LASIK.  Great.

Bye.  I'm your Venus   Well, it's not what I thought it was gonna be either.  Mom, I made some ICU T-shirts.  What's going on? Who are these people?  My team. ICU has exploded.  There's ICU Fashion, ICU Skincare,  ICU Health. It is a gold mine.  Okay, but what does any of this have to do with  seeing people for who they really are?  Oh, pfft, who cares about that?  I do! ICU was an idea I could really believe in,  and you're ruining it.  I'm not ruining it, I'm expanding it.  You know, I'm the one who went blind, Meg.  I'm the one who's suffering.  Now the least I can do is make some money from it.  Now stand back. It's time to make another video.  Hello, Seers, Lois here.  You know, sometimes the darkness gets overwhelming,  and that's when I turn to ICU Essential Oils.  It calms you before sleep, or you can cook chicken in it.  [upbeat music playing.]  Oh, my God.  I can see.  Oh, God, but if anybody finds out, it'll ruin my ICU brand.  Ugh.

I knew it.  Okay, fine. Yes, I can see.  I can't believe you've been lying. Why?  Don't you get it? I have to be blind  to keep the money rolling in.  Nobody's gonna be inspired by a middle-aged, cisgendered,  - able-bodied white woman. - Or man.  Now, you keep your mouth shut, or I will  - Knock knock. - Helen, is that you?  Oh, I'm so blind.

S20e2,PETER:,"That night marked the end  of Jim Morrison's rock god status,  when he was unable to find and expose his penis  in a Florida music venue.  [BOOING.]  Like every man who can't find his penis,  Jim Morrison moved to Paris,  where he did heroin one night and drowned in a bathtub.  There was a movie about the Doors.  If you're a bunch of guys in college  wanting to make all the girls go away,  put on the movie The Doors. Poof, they're gone.  Then it's just you and your buddies.  You could've gotten laid, but you put on The Doors.  Why'd you do that?    Well, if we learned anything from Jim Morrison's tragic tale,  it's that white guys definitely invented rock and roll.  What? That's bullcrap!  Rock and roll was invented in the Mississippi Delta  by Black people.  Jerome, if Black guys invented rock and roll,  then how come everyone else in a vintage vinyl record store  is a stock photo meme white guy?  You ain't heard of the Black man who invented rock and roll  'cause he never got a movie about his life.  But I'm-a educate y'all on the greatest rocker of all time,  Delta bluesman Muddy Drawers.    Muddy grew up in a shotgun shack in the Deep South.  His family was so poor,  they lived underneath the mighty Mississippi.  They all had to share one room  and one mustache.  Well, I'm off to make something of myself with this here guitar.  Don't go chasin' no white women!  Too far away! Can't hear you!    In those days, Black people had nothing,  but they still had to wear suits everywhere.  The only instrument Muddy could afford was a one-string guitar.  That one guitar string was also the family belt.    Despite all his setbacks,  Muddy would do whatever it took to master the guitar,  even if it meant making a deal with the devil himself.  So he headed on down to the crossroads.  The Crossroads being a fancy school in Los Angeles.  Tobey Maguire's kid goes there.  You'd see him sometimes, dropping off.  Not all the time but sometimes.  Hey, Tobey!  See you at the holiday show!  [SCOFFS.] Stupid fanboy.  You ain't ever getting that invite  to dinner with the Gyllenhaals.  Muddy was right.  He never got invited to dinner with Jake Gyllenhaal  or his sleepy-eyed sister,  which is probably for the best.  She looks like she chews with her mouth open.  But Muddy did get his guitar lessons.  From the devil.  Sign here and you'll be the greatest guitar player  who ever lived.  All it'll cost you is your soul.  Okay. You got yourself a deal.  And just so you know, with this purchase of a soul,  I will also give a soul to a child in need.  Yeah, yeah, I don't want that.  - It's no additional cost to you. - [SKEPTICAL.]: Mm-hmm.  It's just my way of giving back, out of my end.  Seems like it's probably baked into the price.  So Muddy went out and created a new sound,  the sound of rock and roll.  It was so groundbreaking  that an apathetic sound mixer put down his newspaper  and his stale cup of coffee to pay attention.    This song has one line   I'm gonna sing it several times   That's it   Well   This song has one line   I'm gonna sing it several times   Not just once   Listen   This song has one line   I'm gonna sing it several times.     The song was a hit  and got Muddy his first record contract.    Now, since he was a Black performer,  naturally, he went on tour  in the part of the country that's so racist  it's known as the Boston of the South.  He was given a white driver.  The record company chose an Italian American man  so Muddy would be used to hearing  all the worst racial slurs  before he got there.  Big crawdads guy, huh?  Oh, yeah. They're the best.  Please look at the road while you're driving.  I wouldn't know about crawdads.  - Never had 'em. - What?  You got to try 'em!  Here, take the rest of mine. I insist."
S20e2,JEROME:,"But Muddy had had crawdads.  Many times.  That was just his little trick for getting free crawdads  from coarse Italians.    What are you working on?  I'm trying to write a nice letter to my wife Margerie,  but I never been any good with  - Damn it, what are those things? - Words?  Yeah, I-I never been any good at words.  In fact, I'm downright great at 'em.  I could help you if you want.  Yeah? Could you make it sound so she thinks me,  a white guy, is the one who actually wrote it?  Easy. Write this.  ""Dearest Margerie,  ""I can't wait to get home  ""and back that big fat ass up.  ""Back, back, back it up.  ""Back, back, back it up.  Wu Tang Clan ain't nothing to mess with."""
S20e2,PETER:,"Dearest Margerie,  a lady who worked at the hotel we were staying at  had, like, the freckliest chest I've ever seen.  Yours, Vinny."
S20e2,JEROME:,"Ultimately, Vinny went his own way  with the letter.    Hey, Muddy, I was thinking,  since we made it to the part of the story  where we realize that we're not so different from each other,  we should celebrate.  Yeah? What did you have in mind?  I don't know. Maybe  that!    [TIRES SCREECH.]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  This is a ""whites only"" carnival.  It's okay, Vinny. Let's get out of here.  No! This is unacceptable, and it will not stand!  My friend is a human being!  We demand recourse!  [SLURPING.]  Unconscionable!"
S20e2,JEROME:,"And though the trip was soon over,  a friendship was formed that transcended race.  But it would not last long.  What the hell?!  All the pages in my songbook are torn out!"
S20e2,PETER:,"Dear Muddy, I have something to confess.  I stole all your songs,  and my real name is Elvis Presley.  That son of a bitch!  Damn you, Elvis Presley!  [SIGHS.] Oh, well.  There's still an exciting future ahead of me.  This ain't the end of my story.  Oh, no. The screen's turnin' sepia.  This is the end of my story!  I got to get to a stool for the one  ""old-timey Black guy musician"" photo  anyone will ever know me by.  Muddy didn't make it to the stool in time for his photo.  Elvis never gave him the credit he deserved.  And people were pissed when Green Book won that Oscar.  The end.    Great story, Jerome.  Elvis really was the best.  Peter, is that Stewie?"
S20e2,PETER:,"Oh, yeah. Looks like he's gonna do one next.  You're gonna let the baby do one?  Oh, I'm sorry, are your children funny?  No.  Ah, here it is.  Elton John's Greatest Hits,  a collection of songs by the one gay guy on earth  with a worse haircut than Pete Rose.    We'll defer that end-of-year bonus  to the following fiscal quarter,  harvest the losses on our cap gains  That's a no-brainer And, let's see,  update my beneficiary designations?  [CHUCKLES.]: Uh, yeah, I think so.  Damn, I'm good.  Elton John, what the hell do you think you're doing?!  It's just a little number crunchin', Pop.  What's going on in here?  Why don't you ask your son, the tax man?  I found these under his mattress!  W-2s!  I-I was holding them for a friend.  Wh-Wh-What are you doin', Pop?  No son of mine is gonna be a heterosexual paper pusher.  You need to be a loud-and-proud performer like your gay old dad!  [AIR WHOOSHING SOFTLY.]  Aah! You hit me!  Oh, Elton. I'm telling you this because I love you.  You'll never find someone to love you.  Not even Dolly Levi could help you.  - Who's Dolly Levi? - [GASPING.]  Oh, where did we go so wrong?!"
S20e2,STEWIE:,"So Elton John collaborated with Bernie Taupin,  who would write the lyrics for Elton's songs.  Bernie was married three times in a desperate bid  to convince the world he was not a homosexual.  [PLAYS NOTE.]  All right, Bernie, what do you got?  Uh, how 'bout this?  ""Yours are the sweetest eyes  I've ever seen.""  They are?  Whoa! I-I'm not gay.  You're not? Y-You just seem very  Yeah. I'm British. We all seem that way,  even if we're not but secretly are.    Elton, meet the best producer in the business.  Kid, how would you like to sign with my label,  Naive-Young-Talent Records.  Together, we are gonna make me millions!  Sounds fair to me. Let's get to it!  From then on, Elton's new male producer  rode him day and night.  When Elton was tired of playing, he'd get right behind him  and push him on the stool until he was finished.  Sometimes Elton would cry  because of how hard he was pushing.  But it paid off, because, in the end,  they had a massive load. Of hits.  Just a just a big, messy load of hits.  The night Elton John performed at Dodger Stadium,  he was so nervous, he almost never left the dressing room.  CROWD [IN DISTANCE.]: Elton! Elton!  Elton! Elton!  Whoa, dude, no!  I'm just a straight moment of clarity.  Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't, uh  But his reflection had walked away,  never to return.  And he had to do his own makeup.  [CHEERING.]  Also, due to a scheduling error,  the Dodgers had a game that night,  and Elton had to bat fourth in the lineup."
S20e2,ANNOUNCER:,"It's a mince-off single and the Dodgers win!  [CHEERING, WHOOPING.]"
S20e2,STEWIE:,"Elton John was heavily involved in the L.A. party scene,  and things took a dark turn one night  when he and Bernie went to a party in the Hollywood Hills,  one where you park way down at the bottom  and have to walk all the way up.  [PANTING.]  God, how much farther is it?  I don't know. You didn't get a TripTik.  That's 'cause the rock star doesn't get the TripTik.  The writer gets the TripTik.  Damn it, here comes another person  walking to the same party.  Let's stop, so we don't have to walk with him the whole way.  When they said this party was ""far out,""  they weren't kidding.  [FORCED CHUCKLING.] I know, right? Yeah.  Look, we've got to be close. I can hear the music.  Damn it! We're in the wrong canyon!  Well, I'm exhausted.  Come on, let's just go home.  I don't know. I kind of want to stay out.  Hang on. Hey!  What's the cocaine sitch like at that party?!  Enough to kill a Belushi!  But you probably don't want to come!  It's a real sausage fest over here!  I'm going to that [BLEEP.] party.  Elton, if you leave me right now, it's a big deal,  because this is the time of the story where that's a big deal.  What'd you say?! I couldn't hear you over the sound of snorting!  Have fun getting home without a TripTik, trip dick!  Whoa-ho! Looks like Elton learned how to write!  [SNORTING.]    How is he, Doctor?  Well, looks like your husband's gonna be all right, Mr., uh  I've been married three times! I'm Bernie Taupin!  You know what, don't worry about it. I already forgot who you are.  Anyway, congratulations.  Elton will be back on his knees in no time.  Look at me. At some hospital  next to a Denny's by the airport.  All day long, it's just Denny's and the jets.  Wait, what'd you just say? Say that again.  The important thing is you're alive.  Thanks. Hey, what do you say we get the ole team back together  for a ""what do they look like now"" credits montage?  Well, we can, but I'm not sure you'll like it."
S20e2,STEWIE:,"That's what I look like?!  Who is letting me out of the house like  Someone in the future is seriously failing me!"
S20e2,BRIAN:,"Yeah, you look like a Candy Land villain that came to life.  -"
S20e2,STEWIE:,"I know! - You look like a Muppet  that teaches kids about being gay."
S20e2,STEWIE:,"All right, that's enough. Why are we making fun of me?  I'm not a bad guy. Let's just make fun of Sean Hannity again."
S20e2,BRIAN:,"He looks like a guy who just OD'd on Just For Men."
S20e2,STEWIE:,He looks like Alan Thicker.
S20e2,BRIAN:,"He's a guy whose wife yells at him  for getting his ball powder all over the bathroom."
S20e2,STEWIE:,"All right, we could do this all day.  For more Hannity slams, go to Family Guy's YouTube page.  And, hey, if you think of your own, leave it in the comments."
S20e2,BRIAN:,"He's the guy your mom dates twice  and then yells at you for the remote."
S20e2,STEWIE:,"[LAUGHS.] Okay. But now we're done.  Well, I can't think of a better way to end our visit  than by remembering the four lads who started a band in 1962  and changed the world forever.  - Steve, Dal, Bob and Robin. - John, Paul, George and Ringo.  - Who? - Steve, Dal, Bob and Robin.  The Trashmen.  Oh  Uh, well, everybody's heard   About the bird   B-B-B-Bird, bird, bird   B-Bird's the word   Uh, well, a bird, bird, bird   Bird is the word, uh, well"

How do you dial a phone or have sex?  Or stand up without using your hands?  Let me tell you something, Brian  (WIND WHISTLES)  Oh, no!  You said it, relatively-short-first-grader.  That Frisbee is way up there.  I'm too scared to climb up that high.  Me, too, average-height-kindergartener.  That jungle gym dates back to the 1930s,  when the lives of children were expendable.  Someone would have to be crazy to climb up there."

This is exactly what I'm talking about!  When are you gonna let the '80s go?  Never! The '80s will always be the best decade.  And I'm confident  that non-whites and women would agree with that.  Everyone else, too. And I'm gonna prove it.  Family! Come here conveniently fast, please!  - What is it, Peter? - I have decided to prove to you all  that the '80s are still relevant and hilarious.  But they're not.  And in keeping with the wonderful 1980s,  I'm gonna go upstairs and drill a hole in the wall  to watch girls shower.  Peter, in addition to that being wildly problematic,  you can't just drill a hole in a structural wall.  Do you even know how to do that?  Okay, that's one drywall bit, one masonry bit,  one spur point bit, one tile bit,  one drill with a hammer action setting,  one wire detector, one stud finder,  and one grease pencil.  Sounds like someone's drilling a hole in the wall  to watch girls shower.  - Oh, big time. - Did you pull a permit?  City hall's next."

Just be a Be a husband to your wife!  Be a father to your children!  You're right, Lois.  No matter how hard I try,  I'll never find a decade as good as the '80s,  like you just said just now.  No, again, that's not at all what I  I need to be alone.  If anyone calls, I'll be in the '70s  doing the might-as-well-be-legal cocaine."

			This is the last straw, Griffin.
			You are fired.
			Fine. I'm not good enough

			Sure, companies need some people

			regular guys who are happy
			to do a thankless job

			day in and day out,

			(INHALES DEEPLY, SIGHS)
			(BEEP, LINE RINGING)
			(RINGING)
			Ha-ha. Got him.
			Glenn Quagmire.
			What is up?
			I lost Stewie in Paris.
			We got separated and I can't find him.
			I'm too ashamed to tell Peter.
			- What? Did you call the police?
			- On strike.
			Brian, you're
			the last guy I want to call,
			but you know Stewie better than anyone.
			Can you help me find him?
			I'll fly you to Paris.
			First class and no male
			flight attendants in my area.
			- Fine.
			- I knew airlines could do that!
			Also, I want a special
			Kibbles 'n Bits meal.
			- Fine
			- Only, Quagmire,
			I want just the bits.
			Come on! Who's gonna pick
			the kibbles out?
			I kind of don't want to have
			to think about that, Glenn.
			Lois, you had a big fall,
			but you're gonna be fine.
			We're getting you to the hospital.
			Oh, Peter, I'm so glad you're here.
			Me, too. Hey, you know,
			you were saying some
			crazy things when you were out.
			I was?
			Yeah, I mean, you said you
			lost 1,100 bucks on Bet Kings.
			I checked the account.
			You definitely lost it.
			But in light of what happened,
			I'm not mad at you.
			I mean, UConn had
			literally never lost to Rutgers
			in lacrosse. I mean, it was free money.
			You're betting on lacrosse now?
			You're not wrong!
			There's no way UConn loses twice
			in a row!
			Plus, Syracuse's all-American
			attacker, Tristan Wyndcroft,
			broke his leg!
			It'll be all Huskies all day!
			Peter, no!
			Just rest, babe!
			I promise I'm not mad at you!
			Where else could Stewie be?
			Should we look in, like, a park?
			""In, like, a park""?
			I flew you out here
			for this level of insight?
			- I thought you knew him!
			- I do know him, okay?
			And I would have taken
			a lot better care of him.
			You lost him, Glenn! How do you do that?
			What, did you go to a-a sex
			place or something
			and leave him tied up outside?
			No! We went out to dinner
			and drank some wine,
			just like every responsible
			adult and child in France.
			But you're right.
			I lost him.
			And now he's gone and it's all my fault.
			I'm a loser. (SNIFFLES, SIGHS)
			I'd do anything to get him back.
			I really miss him.
			- You do?
			- Yeah.
			We really bonded.
			It was nice.
			He's a special little guy, huh?
			Yeah. He sure is.
			We just got to find him.
			And in a town called ""gay Paree,""
			he could literally be anywhere.
			(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
			Where am I?
			What am I going to do?
			My guidebook said
			Marcel Proust is buried there.
			He'll know what to do.

			Ugh. Can't even get through
			his tomb quote.
			(SIGHS)
			I wish Brian were here
			to pretend he gets it.
			(CRYING)
			The Père Lachaise Cemetery.
			We were supposed to go
			before we got separated!
			Yeah, and while we're here,
			I wouldn't mind taking a leak
			on Gérard Depardieu's grave.
			He's still alive.
			Really?
			How?
			Stewie!
			- Stewie!
			- Hey, look!
			- (CRYING)
			- Stewie!
			Brian? What what are you doing here?
			- Quagmire called me
			- (CRYING)
			And, um
			and he told me you guys
			were playing hide-and-seek
			but that you were
			too good a player for him.
			He he did?
			He did. He said he needed my help,
			because I'm a dog and I can smell you.
			You're too good
			to be found any other way.
			You know, this is
			probably the best hiding place
			I've ever seen.
			But it's not
			It-it wasn't
			You really think so?
			I know so.
			Nobody would ever look here.
			It's too scary.
			It is pretty scary.
			Am I the best hide-and-seek
			player in the world?
			Uh, yeah.
			There's the best little
			travel buddy in the world!
			Whoa! I guess I'm really good
			at lots of stuff!
			I'd say we should get a room,
			but we already have one.
			Yep.
			Totally.
			I missed you,
			you unrelenting douche bag.

			I'm sorry you broke your leg, Lois.
			Oh, no, Peter, I'm the one who's sorry.
			I got so wrapped up trying to

			Probably.
			Can I check something

			Uh, Lois?
			You may want to see this.
			Ah! Break's over!

			Oh, Peter, now that I have
